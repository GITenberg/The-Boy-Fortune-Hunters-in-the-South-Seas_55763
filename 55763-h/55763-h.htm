<br /><span class="h2line2">SENOR DE JIMINEZ</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing certain,&rdquo; said my uncle,
Naboth Perkins, banging his fist on the table for
emphasis. &ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t manage get a cargo in
ten days we&rsquo;ll up anchor an&rsquo; quit this bloomin&rsquo;
island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My father the skipper, leaning back in his easy-chair
with his legs&mdash;one of them cork&mdash;stretched
upon the table and his pipe in his mouth, nodded
assent as he replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here it is five weeks since we finished unloadin&rsquo;
that machinery,&rdquo; went on Uncle Naboth,
&ldquo;an&rsquo; since then the <i>Seagull&rsquo;s</i> been floatin&rsquo; like a
swan in the waters o&rsquo; Port Phillip an&rsquo; lettin&rsquo; the
barnacles nip her. There ain&rsquo;t a shipper in Melbourne
as&rsquo;ll give us an ounce o&rsquo; cargo; an&rsquo; why?
Jest because we&rsquo;re American an&rsquo; float the Stars
an&rsquo; Stripes&mdash;that&rsquo;s why. There&rsquo;s a deep-seated
conspiracy agin American shipping in Australia,
an&rsquo; what little truck they&rsquo;ve got to send to
America goes in British ships or it don&rsquo;t go at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again Captain Steele nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;S&rsquo;pose we try Adelaide,&rdquo; suggested big Ned
Britton, our first mate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s jest as bad,&rdquo; declared Uncle Naboth.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an off season, they say; but the fact is,
Australia sends mighty little to the United States,
an&rsquo; those that ship anything prefer English bottoms
to ours. Everything&rsquo;s been contracted for
months ahead, and the only chance the <i>Seagull</i>
has of going home freighted is to grab some
emergency deal&mdash;where time counts&mdash;an&rsquo; load an&rsquo;
skip before any Britisher comes into port.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said my father, inquiringly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve been waitin&rsquo; for, an&rsquo;
I&rsquo;m gettin&rsquo; desprit tired o&rsquo; the job. So now I&rsquo;ll
give these folks jest ten days to rustle up a cargo
for us, an&rsquo; if they don&rsquo;t do it, away we goes in
ballast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I laughed at his earnestness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Uncle Naboth, it won&rsquo;t hurt us to go
home without freight,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;In fact, we&rsquo;ll
make better time, and for my part I see no use in
waiting ten days longer for such a ghostly
chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be foolish, Sam,&rdquo; returned my uncle,
impatiently. &ldquo;Boys never have any business instincts,
anyhow. It&rsquo;s our business to carry
cargoes, so to make the long voyage back home
light-waisted is a howlin&rsquo; shame&mdash;that&rsquo;s what
it is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were paid so much for the cargo we
brought that we can well afford to run home in
ballast,&rdquo; I remarked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>&ldquo;There you go&mdash;jest like a boy. You&rsquo;ve got a
fat bank account, Sam Steele; an&rsquo; so hev I; an&rsquo;
so&rsquo;s the Cap&rsquo;n, your father. An&rsquo; we three own
the <i>Seagull</i> an&rsquo; can do as we blame please with
her. But business is business, as Shylock says to
the lawyers. We&rsquo;re runnin&rsquo; this schooner to make
money&mdash;not one way, but both ways&mdash;an&rsquo; our
business is to see that every league she travels
counts in dollars an&rsquo; cents. Nice merchantmen
we&rsquo;d be to float off home in ballast, jest &rsquo;cause
we got a big lump fer bringin&rsquo; a load of farm
machinery here; wouldn&rsquo;t we, now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t object to your trying for a cargo,
Uncle Naboth. That&rsquo;s your part of the business,
and if any man could make a contract you can do
so; but I see no use in getting annoyed or worried
in case we find it impossible to secure a consignment
of freight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle Naboth smiled grimly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t worried, Sam,&rdquo; he said more mildly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m only tellin&rsquo; you an&rsquo; the Cap&rsquo;n what my
sentiments is.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>We were seated in our pleasant sitting-room
at the Radley Arms, one of the cosiest inns I
ever stopped at. It was a place much patronized
by mariners of the better class and Mrs. Wimp,
our landlady, was certainly a wonderful cook.
Joe Herring, my chum and a lad who, although
only about my own age, served as second mate
of the <i>Seagull</i>, had aroused my uncle to speech by
remarking that as far as he was concerned he
wouldn&rsquo;t mind boarding all winter at the Radley
Arms. But Joe was a silent fellow, as was my
father Captain Steele, and having evoked the above
tirade he said nothing further. Uncle Naboth had
a perfect right to issue his ultimatum concerning
our freight, being supercargo and part owner, and
as our recent voyages had been fairly prosperous
and we were already amply paid for our present
trip to Australia we were all in a mood to take
things philosophically.</p>
<p>I think Ned Britton, the mate, was the most
uneasy of our party, but that was because he disliked
the land and was only comfortable when
afloat. Ned even now lived on shipboard and
kept everything taut and in running order, while
my father, Uncle Naboth and I had rooms at
Mrs. Wimp&rsquo;s admirable inn. I am free to confess
that I like a bit of land loafing now and then,
while poor Ned is never happy unless he knows
the water is sliding under the keel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>Joe and I had ransacked sleepy old Melbourne
pretty well by this time and had enjoyed every
day of the five weeks we had been ashore. There
wasn&rsquo;t a great deal of excitement in town, but
we managed to have a good time and to keep
amused. Our little group had sat in silent meditation
for a few moments following my uncle&rsquo;s
last remark, when Mrs. Wimp stuck her head in
the door and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ow&rsquo;d yer loike to see a gent as wants to
see yer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>We looked at one another inquiringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; demanded Uncle Naboth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;E didn&rsquo;t say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t say what, Mrs. Wimp?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t say &rsquo;oo &rsquo;e were.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he say who he wanted to see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then never mind. Tell him to call again, Mrs.
Wimp,&rdquo; I ventured to say, amused at the landlady&rsquo;s
noncommittal manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; exclaimed my uncle. &ldquo;It may be
somethin&rsquo; about a cargo. Who did he ask for,
Mrs. Wimp?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;E jus&rsquo; dropped in an&rsquo; said: &lsquo;Is the <i>Seagull</i>
people stoppin&rsquo; &rsquo;ere?&rsquo; &lsquo;They is,&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;Then I
wants to see &rsquo;em,&rsquo; says &rsquo;e. So I comes up to see
if it&rsquo;s agreeable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is, Mrs. Wimp,&rdquo; asserted Uncle Naboth.
&ldquo;Be kind enough to show the gentleman up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereat Mrs. Wimp withdrew her head and
closed the door. My father filled his pipe anew
and relighted it. Joe looked thoughtfully out of
the window into the alley below. I turned over a
newspaper that lay upon the table, while Ned and
my uncle indulged in a few remarks about the
repairs recently made to the ship&rsquo;s engines. Not
one of us realized that the next few minutes were
destined to alter the trend of all our lives.</p>
<p>Then came the visitor. He silently opened the
door, closed it swiftly behind him and stood with
his back to it shrewdly eyeing us each one in turn.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>The man&rsquo;s stature was quite short and he was
of slight build. His hair, coarse in texture,
sprinkled with gray and cropped close, stood
straight up on his forehead like a scrubbing
brush. His eyes were black and piercing in expression;
his nose rather too fat; his chin square
and firm; his face long and lean, and his skin of
the dusky olive hue peculiar to natives of southern
climes. His apparel was magnificent. The velvet
coat had gold buttons; he sported a loud checked
vest of purple and orange, and his cravat was a
broad bow of soft white ribbon with gold fringe
at the edges.</p>
<p>At once I began speculating whether he was a
vaudeville actor or a circus barker; but either idea
was dispelled when I noticed his diamonds. These
were enormous, and had a luster that defied imitation.
His shirt buttons were diamonds as big
around as my little finger nail; he had another
monster in the center of his bow tie and his
fingers fairly glittered with gems of the same
character. Every link of a huge watch guard
was set with diamonds, and his cuff buttons were
evidently worth a small fortune.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>The appearance of this small but gorgeous individual
in our dingy sitting-room produced an
incongruous effect. The air was fogged with
tobacco smoke; my father still lazily rested his
legs across the table-top; the rest of us lounged
in unconventional attitudes. However, being
Americans we were more astonished than impressed
by the vision that burst upon us and did
not rise nor alter our positions in any way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which it is the gentleman who the ship <i>Seagull</i>
owns?&rdquo; demanded the stranger, mixing his
English in his agitation, although he spoke it very
clearly for a foreigner.</p>
<p>Uncle Naboth became our spokesman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are three owners,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! where they are?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All in this room,&rdquo; replied my uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excellent!&rdquo; exclaimed our visitor, evidently
pleased. He glanced around him, drew a chair to
the table and sat down. My father moved his
wooden leg a bit to give the stranger more room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is price?&rdquo; he inquired, looking at Mr.
Perkins, whom he faced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Price for what, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ship,&rdquo; said the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you want to buy the ship?&rdquo; gasped my
uncle, fairly staggered by the suggestion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>&ldquo;If you please, if you like; if it is rais&mdash;rais&mdash;raison&mdash;<i>a</i>&mdash;ble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle Naboth stared at him. My father coolly
filled his pipe again. The man&rsquo;s quick eye caught
Joe and I exchanging smiling glances, and he
frowned slightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At what price you hold your ship?&rdquo; he persisted,
turning again to my uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear sir,&rdquo; was the perplexed reply, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve
never figured on selling the <i>Seagull</i>. We built it
to keep&mdash;to have for our own use. We&rsquo;re seamen,
and it&rsquo;s our home. If you&rsquo;d ask us offhand
what we&rsquo;d sell our ears for, we&rsquo;d know
just as well what to answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man nodded, looking thoughtful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the ship cost?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something over two hundred thousand
dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;United State America dollars?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our visitor drew an envelope from his pocket;
laid it on the table and scribbled some figures upon
the back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ver&rsquo; well,&rdquo; he said, presently; &ldquo;I take him at
two hunder thousan&rsquo; dollar, American.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is bargain. What your terms?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cash!&rdquo; snapped Uncle Naboth, laughing at
the man&rsquo;s obstinacy.</p>
<p>The diamond-bedecked man leaned his elbow
on the table and his head on his hand in a reflective
pose. Then he straightened up and
nodded his head vigorously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Of course it must
the cash be. You will know, sir, that a gentleman
does not carry two hunder&rsquo; thousan&rsquo; dollar about
his person, and although I have had more than
that sum on deposit in Bank of Melbourne, it have
been expend in recent purchases. However,
nevertheless, in spite of, I may say, I have ample
fund in Bogota. I will make you draft on my
bank there, and you may sail with me in my ship
and collect the money in gold when we arrive.
That is cash payment, Se&ntilde;or; is not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bogota!&rdquo; remarked my uncle, by this time
thoroughly bewildered. &ldquo;That is a long way off.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>&ldquo;Merely across Pacific,&rdquo; said the other easily.
&ldquo;There is direct route to it through the South
Seas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My father nodded in confirmation of this statement.
He knew his charts by heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Uncle Naboth, sitting up and heaving
a deep sigh, &ldquo;I have not the honor of knowing
who the blazes you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stranger cast a stealthy glance around the
room. Then he leaned forward and said in a low
voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Jiminez.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This impressive statement failed to enlighten
my uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jiminez who?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>For an instant the man seemed offended. Then
he smiled condescendingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure!&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;You are of United
State and have no interest in South American
affairs. It is natural you have ignorance regarding
our politics. In Bogota the name of De
Jiminez stands for reform; and reform stands
for&mdash;&rdquo; He hesitated.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; asked my uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Revolution!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s only nat&rsquo;ral,&rdquo; observed Mr. Perkins
complacently. &ldquo;I hear revolutions are your reg&rsquo;lar
diet down in South America. If there didn&rsquo;t
happen to be a revolution on tap your people
wouldn&rsquo;t know what to do with themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Se&ntilde;or de Jiminez frowned at this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will not politic discuss, if you please,&rdquo; he
rejoined stiffly. &ldquo;We will discuss ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to sell,&rdquo; said my uncle positively.</p>
<p>De Jiminez looked at him speculatively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you with frankness, I must have ship,&rdquo;
said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will tell you that&mdash;but in more privacy,&rdquo; with
a wave of his hand toward our interested group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, these are all <i>Seagull</i> men,&rdquo; announced
Uncle Naboth. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll introduce you, Mr. Yim&mdash;Him&mdash;Jim&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jiminez.&rdquo; He pronounced it &ldquo;He-ma-noth&rdquo;
now, in Spanish fashion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is Captain Steele, our skipper and part
owner,&rdquo; continued my uncle. &ldquo;This young man
is Sam Steele, his son, and also part owner. Sam
is purser and assistant supercargo of the <i>Seagull</i>.
I&rsquo;m supercargo, the third owner, and uncle to
Sam an&rsquo; brother-in-law to the Cap&rsquo;n. Is that all
clear to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>De Jiminez bowed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is Ned Britton, our first mate; and also
Joe Herring, our second mate. Both are trusted
comrades and always know as much as we know.
So what you say, stranger, is as private before
these people as if you spoke to but one of us.
Therefore, fire ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man considered a moment; then he said
slowly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must know there are spies upon me here
in Melbourne, as there are everywhere, whichever
I go; so I cannot too careful be. You ask me why
I want ship. I answer: to carry supplies of war
to Colombia&mdash;arms and ammunition for the
Cause&mdash;all of which I have successful purchase
here in Australia.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh; you&rsquo;re going to start something, are
you?&rdquo; inquired Uncle Naboth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is already start, sir,&rdquo; was the dignified response.
&ldquo;I am to complete the revolution. As
you do not understan&rsquo; ver&rsquo; well, I will the explanation
make that my country is rule by a bad
president&mdash;a dictator&mdash;an autocrat! We call ourselves
republic, Se&ntilde;or Americaine; but see! we
are not now a republic; we are under despotism.
My belove people are all slave to tyrant, who
heeds no law but his own evil desire. Is it not my
duty to break his power&mdash;to free my country?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; answered Mr. Perkins, his calmness
in sharp contrast to the other&rsquo;s agitation.
&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t see as it&rsquo;s any of <i>our</i> bread-and-butter.
It&rsquo;s your country, sir, but you must remember
it&rsquo;s not ours; and to tell you the cold
fact, we don&rsquo;t propose to sell the <i>Seagull</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this Se&ntilde;or de Jiminez looked a bit worried.
But the little Spaniard was game, and did not
give up easily.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>&ldquo;I must have ship!&rdquo; he asserted. &ldquo;I am rich&mdash;have
much money entrusted to me for the Cause&mdash;my
estate is ver&rsquo; large. The best families of Colombia
are all with me; now and always, whatever
I do. See, Se&ntilde;or; it was my ancestor who discover
South America! who discover the River
Orinoco! who was first governor of my country
under the Queen of Spain! Yes, yes. I am descend
direct from the great navigator Gonzalo
Quesada de Jiminez, of whom you read in history.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I congratulate you,&rdquo; said Uncle Naboth dryly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have here in Melbourne congregate the
means to carry on the war, which is now languish
for want of arms and ammunition. It is all ready
to send to Bogota. Therefore, you see, I must
really have ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why buy one?&rdquo; asked my uncle. &ldquo;Why
not send your stuff as freight?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; exclaimed the other. &ldquo;You are
United State. Well, United State forbid any
merchant ship to carry arms to friendly state for
starting revolution. If I hire you to do so I get
you in trouble, and myself in trouble. I want no
quarrel with United State, for when I am myself
President of Colombia I must stand well with
other powers. So it is same with every nation.
I cannot hire a ship. I must buy one and take
responsibility myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This frank and friendly explanation led me to
regard the flashy little man more kindly than before.
I had been busy thinking, knowing that
Uncle Naboth had set his heart on making some
money on the return voyage. So, during the
pause that followed the speech of Se&ntilde;or de Jiminez,
I turned the matter over in my mind and
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me, sir, what you propose doing with the
ship after you get to Colombia with it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stared at me a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is of little use then,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;unless I
could put some cannon on board and use him for
gunboat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you ever been aboard the <i>Seagull</i>?&rdquo; I
continued.</p>
<p>He shook his head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>&ldquo;I have inquire about every ship now in Port
Phillip,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Not one is available but yours
that is big enough to carry my cargo&mdash;all others
are owned in foreign lands and cannot be bought.
But I see your ship, and it look like a good ship;
I inquire and am told by my friends here it is
famous for speed and safety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is all that,&rdquo; agreed my uncle heartily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have a couple of guns on board already,&rdquo;
I continued; &ldquo;for sometimes we sail in seas where
it is necessary for us to protect ourselves. But as
a matter of fact the <i>Seagull</i> would make a poor
gunboat, because she has no protective armor.
So it seems all you could use her for would be to
carry your revolutionary supplies to Colombia and
land them secretly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is all that I require!&rdquo; he said quickly,
giving me a keen look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sam,&rdquo; said my uncle, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to make a
durn fool of yourself; I kin see it in your eye!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER II</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">I ADVANCE A PROPOSITION</span></h2>
<p>By this time all eyes were upon my face, and
realizing that I was about to suggest a bold undertaking
I was a little embarrassed how to continue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For our part, sir,&rdquo; said I, addressing Se&ntilde;or de
Jiminez and keeping my gaze averted from the
others, &ldquo;it is our intention to sail for America
presently, and we would like to carry a good paying
cargo with us. So it strikes me we ought to
find a way to get together. Have you spent all
your funds here in purchases, or have you some
left?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He figured on the envelope again&mdash;eagerly
now, for his quick brain had already grasped my
forthcoming proposition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have still in bank here equal to nine thousan&rsquo;
dollar United State money,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; I rejoined. &ldquo;Now suppose you
purchase from us the <i>Seagull</i> for two hundred
thousand dollars, and pay down nine thousand
in cash, agreeing to resell the ship to us as soon
as we are free of the cargo for the sum of one
hundred and ninety-one thousand dollars, accepting
your own draft, which you are to give us, in
full payment. In that way the thing might be
arranged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had brightened up wonderfully during my
speech and was about to reply when Uncle Naboth,
who had been shaking his head discontentedly,
broke in with:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Sam, it won&rsquo;t do. It ain&rsquo;t enough by
half. Your scheme is jest a makeshift an&rsquo; I kin
see where we might get into a peck o&rsquo; trouble
aidin&rsquo; an&rsquo; abettin&rsquo; a rebellion agin a friendly country.
Moreover, you don&rsquo;t take into account the
fact that we&rsquo;ve got to operate the ship across
the South Seas, an&rsquo; the salaries an&rsquo; wages fer
such a long voyage amounts to considerable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have respect for Uncle Naboth&rsquo;s judgment,
so was rather crestfallen at his disapproval. But
Se&ntilde;or de Jiminez, who was alert to every phase
of the argument, said quickly:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is true. Nine thousan&rsquo; dollar is too much
for an ordinary voyage, and too little for such
voyage as I propose. I will pay fifteen thousan&rsquo;
dollar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t the cash,&rdquo; remarked my uncle,
&ldquo;and revolutions are uncertain things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jiminez took time to muse over the problem,
evidently considering his dilemma from every
viewpoint. Then he began to shed his diamonds.
He took out his jeweled cuff buttons, his studs,
pin and watch guard, and laid them on the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;are twenty thousan&rsquo; dollar
worth of jewels&mdash;the finest and purest diamonds
in all the world. I offer them as security. You
take my nine thousan&rsquo; dollar in gold, and my personal
note for six thousan&rsquo;, which I pay as soon
as in Colombia we land. If I do not, you keep
the diamonds, which bring you much more in
your own country. You see, gentlemen, I trust
you. You are honest, but you make a hard bargain&mdash;hard
for the man who must use you in
spite of difficulty. But I have no complaint. I
am in emergency; I must pay liberally to accomplish
my great purpose. So then, what is result?
Do I purchase the ship as Se&ntilde;or Sam Steele he
describe?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>Uncle Naboth hesitated and looked at my
father, who had listened with his usual composure
to all this but said not a word. Now he
removed his pipe, cleared his throat and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m agree&rsquo;ble. Colombia ain&rsquo;t so blame much
out&rsquo;n our way, Naboth. An&rsquo; the pay&rsquo;s lib&rsquo;ral
enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think, Ned?&rdquo; asked my uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Cap&rsquo;n&rsquo;s said it,&rdquo; answered the mate,
briefly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe started and looked around at being thus
appealed to. He was only a boy; but Uncle Naboth
knew from experience that Joe never spoke
without thinking and that his thoughts were
fairly logical ones.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>&ldquo;The deal looks all right on the face of it, sir,&rdquo;
said he. &ldquo;But before you sign a contract I&rsquo;d
know something more of this gentleman and his
prospects of landing his arms in safety, so we
can get away from Colombia without a fight.
Let Sam find out all he can about this revolution
and its justice, and get posted thoroughly. Then,
if it still seems a safe proposition, go ahead, for
the terms are fair enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; answered Uncle Naboth, &ldquo;we
don&rsquo;t mean to jump before we look. Other things
bein&rsquo; equal an&rsquo; satisfaction guaranteed, I&rsquo;ll say
to you, Mr. Jim&mdash;Yim&mdash;Jiminez, that I b&rsquo;lieve
we can strike a bargain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little man&rsquo;s face had seemed careworn as
he listened intently to this exchange of ideas.
Evidently he was desperately anxious to get the
<i>Seagull</i> to deliver his contraband goods. But he
offered no objection to Joe&rsquo;s cautious suggestion.
Instead he turned to me, after a little thought,
and said:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>&ldquo;Time is with me very precious. I must get to
Bogota as soon as possible&mdash;to the patriots awaiting
me. So to satisfy your doubts I will quickly
try. It is my request, Se&ntilde;or Sam, that you accompany
me to my hotel, and the evening spend
in my society&mdash;you and your friend Se&ntilde;or Joe.
Then to-morrow morning we will sign the papers
and begin to load at once the ship. Do you then
accept my hospitality?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I turned to Uncle Naboth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think you can trust Joe and me?&rdquo; I
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess so,&rdquo; he responded. &ldquo;Your jedgment&rsquo;s
as good as mine in this deal, which is a gamble
anyway you put it. Go with Mr. Jiminez, if you
like, and find out all he&rsquo;ll let you. Mostly about
him, though; nobody knows anything about a revolution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, Uncle,&rdquo; I answered. Then I turned
to the Colombian. &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;we cordially
accept your invitation. You seem fair and just
in your dealings and for the present, at least, I&rsquo;m
glad to have formed your acquaintance. Keep
your diamonds until we ask for the security. As
you sail in our company you may as well wear
them until circumstances require us to demand
them of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He bowed and restored the gems to their
former places. Then he rose and took his hat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>&ldquo;You will return with me to my apartments?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you desire it,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, Se&ntilde;ors, I am at your service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe quietly left his seat, saying: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be ready
in a jiffy, Sam,&rdquo; and started for his room&mdash;a
room we shared together. After a moment&rsquo;s
hesitation I followed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Slick up a bit and pack my toothbrush.
Didn&rsquo;t you hear De Jiminez speak of his &lsquo;apartments&rsquo;
at the hotel? And we&rsquo;re to stay all night
it seems.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True enough,&rdquo; I exclaimed. &ldquo;We must look
decent, old man,&rdquo; and I quickly changed my clothing
and threw into a small grip such articles as I
thought might be needed. Joe was ready before
me, and I saw him quietly slip a revolver into his
hip pocket; so I did the same, smiling at the incongruity
of going armed to make a semisocial
visit.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>We found Se&ntilde;or de Jiminez slightly impatient
when we returned to the sitting-room, so we
merely said good-bye to our friends and followed
him out to the street. The Radley Arms was situated
in a retired and very quiet district, and our
exit seemed entirely unobserved except by our
curious landlady. A sleepy beggar was sitting on
the corner, and before him the Colombian paused
and said in a calm tone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will your report be, then? That I have
visited the Radley Arms? Well, let me give you
help. I had friends there&mdash;these young gentlemen&mdash;who
are returning with me to my hotel.
You will find us there this evening and until
morning. Will such information assist you, my
good spy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The beggar grinned and replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a rare one, De Jiminez. But don&rsquo;t
blame me; I&rsquo;m only earnin&rsquo; my grub.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said the other, gravely. &ldquo;You do the
dirty work for my countryman, the chief spy.
But I do not care; you are both powerless to injure
me, or to interfere with my plans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he walked on, and a short distance down
the street hailed a cab that was rolling by. We
three entered the vehicle and were driven directly
into the busiest section of the city.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>&ldquo;The driver of this cab,&rdquo; remarked De Jiminez,
&ldquo;is also a spy; and if you could behind us see you
would find the beggar riding with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They seem to keep good track of you, Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo;
said Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not mind,&rdquo; answered the man. &ldquo;If my
arrangement with you succeeds I shall be able to
get away from here before my enemies can interfere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was already growing late in the day and
the streets were lighted as we entered the main
thoroughfares. Our host seemed lost in thought
and few remarks were exchanged between us
during the long ride.</p>
<p>Finally we drew up before an imposing looking
edifice which I quickly recognized as the Hotel
Markham, quite the swellest public house in all
Melbourne. It cost one a lot to stop at such a
place I well knew, but reflected that Se&ntilde;or de
Jiminez, if important enough to conduct a revolution,
might be expected to live in decent style&mdash;especially
if the &ldquo;patriots&rdquo; paid his expenses.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>I suppose it would be becomingly modest to
admit right here that Joe and I were rather young
to be sent on such an errand. Perhaps Se&ntilde;or de
Jiminez recognized this fact even more fully than
we did. But in justice to ourselves I must add
that we were boys of more than ordinary experience,
our adventures on many voyages having
taught us to think quickly, act coolly and carefully
consider every motive presented to us. Predisposed
as I was in favor of this queer Colombian,
who interested me because he was playing a desperate
game and had the nerve to play it well, I
had no intention of deceiving myself or allowing
him to deceive me in regard to his standing and
responsibility. It was my business to find out all
I could about the man, and I fully intended to
keep my eyes and ears wide open.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>The first thing I noticed as we entered the hotel
was the respectful deference paid our conductor
by the servants, who seemed eager to wait upon
him. The manager came from his little booth
with a smile and bow for Se&ntilde;or de Jiminez and
promptly assigned Joe and me to a large room
which he said was connected with the &ldquo;suite&rdquo; of
our host. De Jiminez himself conducted us to
this room, a very luxurious chamber, and then
excused himself, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will wish to prepare for dinner and I
must the same do also. When you are ready, be
kind to come into my apartments, Number 18,
which is the first door at your left. Have you
necessaries in everything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>We assured him we were amply provided for
and he left us with a courteous bow. There
wasn&rsquo;t much for us to do, except to wash and
brush ourselves and examine the rich furnishings
of the place. Neither Joe nor I was an utter
stranger to luxurious living, although our ordinary
quarters were commonplace enough and our
mode of life extremely simple. We have seen
palaces of great magnificence, and therefore the
handsome room assigned us did not impress us
as much as it interested us.</p>
<p>We whiled away half or three-quarters of an
hour in order not to crowd our host too closely,
and then we knocked at the door of room Number
18.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER III</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">WE MEET SOME QUEER PEOPLE</span></h2>
<p>A servant in private livery admitted us to a
spacious drawing-room and Se&ntilde;or de Jiminez,
arrayed in a regulation dress suit, in which he
appeared far more imposing than in the flashy
attire he had before worn, advanced quickly to
greet us. At a center table sat an aged, pleasant
faced lady and crouching in a chair by the fireplace
was a youth of about my own age, who
bore so strong a facial resemblance to De Jiminez
that it needed no shrewdness to guess he was his
son.</p>
<p>Our host led us first to the lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young gentlemen,&rdquo; said he, as with profound
deference he bowed before her, &ldquo;I have the honor
to present my mother, Se&ntilde;ora de Jiminez.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She smiled graciously and extended her hands
to us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is unfortune,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;that she is not
with your English language familiar.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but I speak Spanish&mdash;a little,&rdquo; said I; for
I had learned it during a sojourn in Panama.
Then I told the lady I was glad to meet her,
speaking in her own tongue, and she bade me
welcome.</p>
<p>De Jiminez seemed pleased. He next led me to
the young fellow by the fire, who had not risen
nor even glanced toward us, but seemed tremendously
interested in his own thoughts. These
could not have been very pleasant, judging from
the somber expression of his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My son Alfonso,&rdquo; said our host, introducing
us. &ldquo;Alfonso, I present Mr. Steele and Mr. Herring,
two young American gentlemen I have
recently met.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy looked up quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not of the <i>Seagull</i>!&rdquo; he exclaimed in English.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then&mdash;&rdquo; he began eagerly; but his father
stopped him with a gesture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am making consideration of a proposition
they have made to me,&rdquo; he observed with dignity.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps, Alfonso, we may sail back to Colombia
in the <i>Seagull</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy&rsquo;s eyes glistened. They were dark and
restless eyes, very like those of his parent. He
rose from his chair and shook hands with us with
an appearance of cordiality. We now saw he was
remarkably short of stature. Although he was
sixteen the crown of his head scarcely reached to
my shoulder. But he assumed the airs and dress
of a man and I noticed he possessed his father&rsquo;s
inordinate love for jewelry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you prefer in the hotel restaurant to
dine, or in our private salon?&rdquo; inquired the elder
De Jiminez.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is unimportant to us, sir,&rdquo; I returned. &ldquo;Do
not alter your usual custom on our account, I beg
of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I will order service in the
salon.&rdquo; He seemed relieved and went to consult
his servant.</p>
<p>Meantime young Alfonso looked at us curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not own the <i>Seagull</i>, I suppose,&rdquo; he
remarked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; I asked with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fine ship. I&rsquo;ve been over to look at it
this afternoon&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh; you have!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. They would not let me go aboard, but I
saw all I wished to. It is swift and trim&mdash;what
is called &lsquo;yacht built.&rsquo; It can sail or go by steam.
Your crew looks like a good one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is all true, sir,&rdquo; I agreed, amused at his
observations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you young fellows own it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Joe. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m second mate, that&rsquo;s
all. But Mr. Steele here is one-third owner, with
his father and uncle owning the other two-thirds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alfonso looked at me intently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you sold it to my father?&rdquo; he asked in
a low voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; said I, laughing. &ldquo;But, as Se&ntilde;or de
Jiminez told you, we are considering the matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know why we want it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We&rsquo;?&rdquo; I repeated. &ldquo;Are you also a conspirator&mdash;pardon
me, a patriot&mdash;then?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am a De Jiminez,&rdquo; he returned proudly.
&ldquo;After my father I am entitled to rule over Colombia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To rule? That savors of monarchy. I
thought Colombia is a republic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are quite right. It <i>is</i> a republic&mdash;as
Mexico is; as Venezuela and Costa Rica are. But
the president has great power. Is not Diaz equal
to a king?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not very well posted on South American
or Mexican politics,&rdquo; I replied evasively. &ldquo;But
from what your father said I imagine there is
already a president in Colombia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gave a frown at this, amusingly like his
father&rsquo;s frown. Then his face cleared and he
said:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>&ldquo;Permit me to explain. The family of De Jiminez
has controlled Colombian politics ever since
my great ancestor discovered the country and
called it New Grenada. But a few years ago,
while my father was traveling in Europe, the opposition
obtained control and still has the presidency.
The important and wealthy class, however, resented
the usurpation, and even before my father
alarmed at the situation hurried back home, a revolution
had begun. I say a revolution, because the
opposition had firmly established themselves. We
are really attempting a restoration of the rightful
party to its former power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In our own republic,&rdquo; I said thoughtfully, &ldquo;the
votes of the majority rule. Why do you not resort
to the ballot instead of to arms?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have visited your country,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The
conditions there are different. In Colombia we
have a small class of wealthy and influential people
and a horde of vulgar laborers who are little
more than slaves. They have small intelligence,
no education, and work for a bare living. My
father tried to establish a school system that
would enable them to rise above such conditions.
They would not send their children to the schools.
Then he tried to force them by law&mdash;compulsory
education you know, copied from your own and
other countries&mdash;but they rebelled at this and the
opposition made capital out of their resentment.
The result was the overthrow of the De Jiminez
party as I have stated.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>This seemed to put a new aspect on the revolution.
I began to approve the action of the De
Jiminez party and to sympathize with their
&ldquo;cause.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has your father many followers in Colombia?&rdquo;
I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The intelligent class is of course with him;
small in numbers but controlling the wealth of the
country. We ourselves are coffee planters and
bankers, and we employ several hundred laborers
who will do whatever we may direct&mdash;and do it
willingly. Many of the families in sympathy with
us can also control their servants; but we have
found great difficulty in securing arms and ammunition
for them. We have organized and drilled
several regiments&mdash;I have drilled our own men
myself&mdash;but they cannot fight without weapons.
That is why we are so eager to ship our cargo of
arms to Colombia.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>The elder De Jiminez had returned in time to
hear the conclusion of this speech, and he nodded
approval. It seemed to me that the little fellow
really talked remarkably well. He spoke better
English than his father and expressed himself in
well chosen language. It at once occurred to me
why Joe and I had been invited here. The young
De Jiminez was a rabid partisan of &ldquo;the Cause&rdquo;
and his clever father imagined that an enthusiastic
boy would be more apt to impress boys of his own
age than his senior might impress men. The
thought put me somewhat on my guard and made
me inquire into things more carefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Australia seems a queer place to obtain a
cargo of arms,&rdquo; I remarked. &ldquo;There are no factories
here I believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said our host, &ldquo;the arms I purchased
came from England consigned to a local firm. We
could not purchase direct for it would result in
international complications; but we have many
friends here in Australia. It is a favorite resort
for exiles from my country, and that is why I
arranged the purchase here. But come; dinner is
served and I hope you have good appetites.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>He gave his arm to his old mother, who was
remarkably active for her years, and led the way
to a connecting room where the dinner was served.
It was a fine spread, and Joe and I did full justice
to the many courses.</p>
<p>Afterward we returned to the drawing-room,
where the old lady read a Spanish periodical while
we chatted in English concerning Colombian
affairs and the revolution.</p>
<p>I learned that the De Jiminez family was considered
among the wealthiest of the republic. Our
host conducted an important banking business in
Bogota and had extensive coffee plantations in the
foothills. He was not directly known as the
leader of the revolutionists, but would be chosen
the new president by the insurgents if they succeeded
in overturning the present government.
Yet De Jiminez was scarcely safe in his own country
just at present and intended to land in a secret
cove on the coast and transport his cargo of arms
inland to one of the rendezvous of the revolutionists.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>Young Alfonso was as ardent a partisan as his
father. He was tremendously ambitious and it
seemed his father encouraged this, telling his son
many times that the future of his country would
some day be dependent upon the boy&rsquo;s ability and
courage and that he must uphold the honorable
name of De Jiminez.</p>
<p>Their assumed importance was of course amusing
to me, who looked upon their seven by nine
country with tolerant disdain; but to them Colombia
and the revolution were the most tremendous
things in the world. And, after all they were
simple, kindly people, honestly inclined and desirous
of improving the conditions in their native
land if this &ldquo;tempest in a teapot&rdquo; resulted in their
favor. I had already decided that we would be
justified in concluding the deal with Se&ntilde;or de
Jiminez when a diversion was created by the arrival
of visitors.</p>
<p>The servant ushered two ladies into the room.
One was a beautiful woman of middle age and
the other a tall, slim girl who was evidently her
daughter. Both were exquisitely dressed and impressed
me as persons of importance even before
I noticed the extreme courtesy with which our
host greeted them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>Introductions followed. The elder lady was
Se&ntilde;ora de Alcantara of Bogota, and the younger
her daughter Lucia. At once Madam inquired in
an eager tone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, De Jiminez, have you succeeded in
getting a ship?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; he replied, glancing at me a bit
doubtfully. &ldquo;The only thing still to be settled is
the matter of terms. I have not much money left
to satisfy the owners, who have no confidence in
their being able to collect when we arrive at Colombia.
But I hope it can yet be arranged in a
satisfactory manner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I also hope so,&rdquo; she returned, &ldquo;for I am anxious
to travel home in your company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo; he exclaimed in unfeigned astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I have just received letters of absolute
pardon from the government. I am free to return
to my home in Bogota whenever I please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You surprise me, Se&ntilde;ora,&rdquo; he said, evidently
disturbed by the news. Then he took the lady
aside, and while they were conversing privately
Alfonso said to us:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>&ldquo;De Alcantara, her husband, was the first
leader of the revolution, and was killed in battle
two years ago. His wife and daughter fled to
Australia and their estates were confiscated. This
is indeed surprising news; but I think the government
wishes to placate the wealthy classes by this
lenient action.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Se&ntilde;or de Jiminez returned to our group smiling
and content. I overheard Madam de Alcantara
say in Spanish to Madam de Jiminez. &ldquo;Never,
under any circumstances, will I abandon the
Cause. I shall return to my estates, because here
I am an exile and dependent upon our friends for
maintenance. There I may intrigue to advance
the revolution, although I am warned against
mixing in politics if I accept the government&rsquo;s
amnesty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Cause is sacred to us all,&rdquo; was the calm
reply.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>Lucia de Alcantara was at once monopolized
by Alfonso, who deserted us to pay the young
girl marked attention. She did not appear to resent
this; neither did she respond with much
enthusiasm. She was really a beautiful girl, not
more than fifteen or sixteen years of age, and her
slender, willowy form towered so far above the
undersized Alfonso that I remarked to Joe, aside:
&ldquo;That certainly is the long and short of it old man,
isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose there will be accommodations in
the <i>Seagull</i> for the ladies?&rdquo; inquired Se&ntilde;or de
Jiminez.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;they might be made fairly comfortable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said no more then, but presently sat down
to a quiet game of bezique with Madam de Alcantara,
leaving Alfonso to entertain us as well as
Lucia. We found that the girl spoke English, and
she became so interested in our accounts of the
United States that she fairly ignored the youthful
Colombian to question us about our country, our
ship, and the chances of our sailing together
across the South Seas.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>It was quite late when they left, Alfonso and
his father both escorting their guests to the carriage,
and on their return Joe and I pleaded
fatigue and retired to our rooms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Joe,&rdquo; I said, when we were alone,
&ldquo;what do you think now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mighty pretty girl,&rdquo; he returned musingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But about the business deal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that,&rdquo; he responded, waking up, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in
favor of it, taking it all around. We get well
paid and run no especial chances except when we
land the goods. We&rsquo;ve done harder things than
that, Sam, for less money; so it needn&rsquo;t bother
us much. You see the Alcantaras can have the
for&rsquo;ard cabin and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bother the Alcantaras!&rdquo; I exclaimed impatiently.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re usually opposed to passengers,
Joe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know; but they&rsquo;re anxious to get home and
Lucia said&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Lucia!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that her name?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe it is.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a clever sort of a girl. Usually, Sam,
girls are dubs; but this Spanish creature has lots
of &lsquo;go&rsquo; to her and won&rsquo;t make bad company on
the voyage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I let him alone, then, and went to bed. Joe
Herring was a silent fellow at ordinary times, but
if I had let him ramble on about this girl I am sure
he&rsquo;d have kept me awake half the night. It
didn&rsquo;t strike me there was anything remarkable
about her either.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER IV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">NUX AND BRYONIA</span></h2>
<p>Our report seemed to satisfy my uncle and my
father when we returned to the Radley Arms at
ten o&rsquo;clock the next morning. At twelve Se&ntilde;or
de Jiminez appeared in his checked vest and diamonds
and signed the contract, paying us nine
thousand dollars in gold and giving us a draft on
his own bank in Bogota for six thousand. We
also secured papers granting us the right to repurchase
the <i>Seagull</i> by returning the notes we
accepted for the sale price, which notes we believed
not worth the paper they were written on.
Then, all business details being completed and the
ship formally turned over to its new owner, the
early afternoon saw us all aboard the <i>Seagull</i> engaged
in stowing the cases of arms and ammunition
which had already begun to arrive. De
Jiminez did not intend to waste any time, that was
certain, and one dray after another brought our
freight to the lighter, which transferred it to the
ship.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>The boxes were of all sizes and shapes, being
labeled in big black letters &ldquo;Machinery.&rdquo; They
were consigned to the coffee plantation of De
Jiminez. There were a lot of them and they were
tremendously heavy things; but we stowed them
in the hold as rapidly as they arrived and two
days sufficed to get the entire cargo aboard.</p>
<p>On the evening of the second day our passengers
boarded us. There were five of them
including the elder De Jiminez, his mother and
son, and Madam de Alcantara and her daughter.
They were accompanied by trunks and bandboxes
galore; enough to make my father grunt disdainfully
and Uncle Naboth look glum. I think none
of us&mdash;except perhaps our erratic second mate,
Joe&mdash;was greatly delighted at the prospect of
female passengers on a long voyage; but we had
made our bargain and must abide by it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>De Jiminez had bustled around all day getting
the ship&rsquo;s papers in shape and preparing for the
voyage, while young Alfonso, whom Uncle Naboth
had promptly dubbed &ldquo;Little Jim,&rdquo; attended
to the loading of the boxes with the coolness and
care of a veteran. They couldn&rsquo;t wait a moment
after the last case of arms was aboard. Bill
Brace, the engineer, had steam up long ahead of
time; so at dusk we hoisted anchor and slowly
steamed out of Port Phillip into the calm blue
waters of the South Pacific. If any government
spies watched De Jiminez depart he was indifferent
to them, and they were now powerless to
interfere with his plans.</p>
<p>The comfort of our passengers depended wholly
upon two men of our crew whom I have not yet
had the opportunity of introducing to you. Our
own personal comfort had depended upon them
for years, so I am justified in making the above
statement. They were gigantic blacks; not negroes
of the African type, but straight-haired
ebony fellows who were natives of some island in
these very seas where we were now sailing. Their
names were Nux and Bryonia, and one was our
steward and the other our cook&mdash;fairly entitled,
indeed, to be called our &ldquo;chef.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>Concerning these curious names there is a serio-comic
story which I will briefly relate.</p>
<p>A number of years ago, while Uncle Naboth
Perkins was sailing an old tub he and my father
jointly owned on a voyage from New Zealand to
San Francisco, he encountered somewhere in the
South Seas a native canoe drifting upon the
waves. It seemed at first to be vacant, but as it
passed close to the lee of the slow-going sailing
vessel the seamen noticed something lying flat in
the bottom of the dugout. They threw a grappling
hook and drew the little boat alongside,
when they discovered two black men lying bound
hand and foot and senseless from lack of food
and water. How many days they had drifted
about in that condition no one could tell, least of
all the poor victims. Being hoisted aboard the
bodies were laid side by side upon the deck and
Uncle Naboth, who was the only excuse for a
physician there was aboard, examined them and
found that both were still alive. But the condition
of the poor fellows was exceedingly precarious.
Had they not possessed such stalwart
frames and splendid constitutions they would have
been dead long before.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>So Uncle Naboth brought out the ship&rsquo;s medicine
chest and found it rather shy of restoratives.
Aside from calomel and quinine, neither of which
seemed appropriate for the case, the only remedies
the chest contained were two bottles of homeopathic
pills&mdash;one of nux vomica and the other of
bryonia.</p>
<p>My uncle pondered a time between these unknown
medicines and decided to give one black
the nux and the other the bryonia, hoping thus to
save at least one of the disabled castaways. So a
course of treatment began. Both were liberally
fed brandy and water and one was given six pills
of nux vomica and the other six pills of bryonia,
the doses being administered every hour. Mr.
Perkins became intensely interested in the results,
and that no mistake might be made he labeled one
black boy &ldquo;Nux&rdquo; and the other &ldquo;Bryonia.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Nux&rdquo; regained consciousness first, and while the
amateur physician was regretting that he had not
fed them both the same dope &ldquo;Bryonia&rdquo; opened
his eyes to the world again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>I have always suspected the brandy and water
really did the job, but Uncle Naboth was so
proud of his medical skill that he will never admit
that possibility.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a doctor&rsquo;s duty to guess,&rdquo; he has said
more than once referring to this occasion, &ldquo;an&rsquo; I
managed to guess right because I only had two
medicines an&rsquo; both of &rsquo;em was recommended to
kill or cure. The dog-gone little sugar pills must
&rsquo;a&rsquo; had extract o&rsquo; magic in &rsquo;em; that&rsquo;s what I
think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anyhow, Nux and Bryonia got well and regained
their strength, and more grateful fellows
never lived. Neither could understand a word of
English, while their own language was a puzzle to
all the crew; but they were quick to observe and
ready to undertake any work that lay at hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>Not knowing where to drop the castaways, nor
wishing to delay the voyage because of two black
men, my uncle decided to carry them along with
him, and their intelligence and devotion so won
him that before the voyage ended he prized Nux
and Bryonia more than all the rest of the crew
put together. They gradually picked up a word
of English here and there until they were able to
make themselves understood, and in time they
learned to speak it fluently. But they had never
a word to say of their experiences or past life and
we really knew little about their antecedents.</p>
<p>The following year we had another ship in
which I sailed my first voyage with Uncle Naboth,
and Nux and Bryonia watched over me so faithfully&mdash;saving
my life on one important occasion&mdash;that
I learned to regard them both very highly
and a friendship was formed between us that time
has only strengthened. So of course when we
built our fine new ship the <i>Seagull</i>, Nux and Bry
became fixtures in it as much as we were ourselves,
and I must admit that no owners ever had
more faithful or capable servants.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>Bryonia was the taller of the two, although
both were stalwart fellows, and perhaps he was a
bit more shrewd and active than Nux. He became
our cook, learning the art with amazing
rapidity, and I am positive that no ship&rsquo;s cook
ever lived who was his superior. Nux, a jolly
good-natured fellow who was strong as an ox,
was our steward and cared for the after cabin
perfectly. They did other tasks when occasion
required, and the two have accompanied me in
more than one hair-raising adventure, proving
themselves plucky, intelligent and true to the bone.
Somehow we had all come to depend greatly
upon our black South Sea Islanders, and they in
turn were very fond of us&mdash;especially of Uncle
Naboth and myself.</p>
<p>It so happened that this was the first voyage
since they were picked up that had taken us to the
South Seas. We had been to Alaska, to Panama,
to Egypt, China and Yucatan, but the fortune of
commerce now led us for the first time into the
South Pacific. When first we headed for Australia
I had said to them:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, boys, you&rsquo;re going somewhere near
your native land on this voyage.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>They exchanged a quick glance but said nothing
in reply. They seemed neither overjoyed nor
sorry, but accepted this journey with the same
calm philosophy they had the others. In mentioning
the incident to Uncle Naboth he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why our going through the South
Seas should make any difference to them. Why,
Sam, the South Pacific has a million little islands
in it, none of which amounts to a row of pins.
Nux and Bry were natives of one of these dinky
islands an&rsquo; I guess they had a hard, wild life of it
judging from the condition they was in when I
found &rsquo;em. My pickin&rsquo; &rsquo;em up was great luck for
the pair an&rsquo; no mistake. They&rsquo;re civilized Injuns,
now, an&rsquo; their life on shipboard is luxury compared
to what they used to have. Besides we&rsquo;ve
treated &rsquo;em well an&rsquo; they&rsquo;ve grown fond of us;
I doubt if we landed plump on their native island
they&rsquo;d ever leave the ship an&rsquo; go back to their old
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should hope not!&rdquo; I exclaimed. &ldquo;How old do
you think they are, Uncle Naboth? Whenever I
ask them they shake their heads and say they do
not know.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps they don&rsquo;t; many of the savage races
never keep track of their age; they think it&rsquo;s bad
luck to count the years. But I should judge these
fellows are about twenty-five years old. Nux may
be a little older, but not much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps it was natural that these native
islanders should be a source of much curiosity to
Alfonso de Jiminez and Lucia de Alcantara.
They were accustomed to seeing dark-skinned
races, and in Australia one meets Borneans, Samoans,
the East India and native Malay tribes,
Philippinos, Japs and Chinese; but such handsome
and dignified blacks as Nux and Bryonia were different,
indeed, and I have often thought the desert
Moors the nearest approach to them of any people
I have ever seen.</p>
<p>Our islanders wore neat uniforms of gray and
gold, which rendered their appearance the more
striking. They would never accept money for
their service, saying they owed their lives and
happiness to us and could never repay us. Moreover
they declared they had no use for money.
But they delighted in their uniforms, so we kept
them well supplied and they wore them at all
times.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>The addition of five passengers to our complement
did not phase Bry in the least. On the
contrary it gave him a chance to cook some of the
delicious dishes for which he was famous among
ourselves, and so to extend his reputation. Nux
had more extra work than his comrade, looking
after the cabins and serving the meals; but he had
a great capacity for work and made no complaint
whatever.</p>
<p>Captain Steele had been a mariner all his life
and was no stranger to the South Seas; but this
course from Melbourne to the coast of Colombia,
while not unknown to the charts, was strange to
him and he had to put in a lot of study before he
got his lines properly marked and knew exactly
where to travel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ye see, Sam,&rdquo; he said to me one evening as I
sat in his cabin watching him figure, &ldquo;it would be
all plain sailin&rsquo; if it warn&rsquo;t fer them measley little
islands&mdash;hundreds of &rsquo;em the chart shows, an&rsquo;
there&rsquo;s indycations of hundreds more that ain&rsquo;t
been located. If we get a hair&rsquo;s breadth off our
course we&rsquo;ll have to do a good bit of dodgin&rsquo;.
The spots on the chart marked islands means a
lot of rocks in plain English, an&rsquo; rocks won&rsquo;t do
the <i>Seagull</i> any good if we happen to bump agin
&rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there a way to avoid most of the
islands?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that anyone knows of. The South Seas
is spotted with &rsquo;em most everywheres an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s
better to keep in your reg&rsquo;lar course, where you
know your soundin&rsquo;s, than to try findin&rsquo; a clearer
track over to Colombia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see,&rdquo; I said, tracing the chart with my
finger; &ldquo;our course lies directly through the Low
Archipelago. What a lot of islands there are!
But there seems to be plenty of room between
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; agreed my father. &ldquo;Give us
weather like this an&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll dodge every rock in
our way.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>I understood what he meant. The weather is
treacherous in these seas near the equator, and it
would be bad for us to encounter a storm among
the rocky shoals of the islands. Just now the
weather was magnificent and the sea as smooth as
glass. Our engines were in fine working order
and we made sufficient speed to satisfy even the
restless new &ldquo;owner,&rdquo; Se&ntilde;or de Jiminez.</p>
<p>A piano was in the main cabin and Lucia played
and sang very agreeably. Her songs were mostly
those dreamy Spanish things with melody enough
to haunt you long afterward, and Joe especially
listened with eagerness to every note, although
&ldquo;Little Jim&rdquo; was always on hand to turn the music.
Joe couldn&rsquo;t do that, not being able to read a note
and he was often on duty besides; but Lucia knew
he appreciated her music and whether our boy
mate was in the cabin or tramping the deck overhead
she played to please him more than she did
Alfonso.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>Now that all the hurly-burly of stowing the
cargo and getting under way was over, our passengers
settled down to enjoy the voyage, and it
was then that the peculiar traits in their various
characters became noticeable. I admit that we are
all peculiar in one way or another, as some clever
student of human nature has observed and recorded
before my time. Perhaps, therefore, our
new acquaintances were no more odd in their ways
than the ordinary run of humanity.</p>
<p>Madam de Jiminez was as placid and contented
as the day was long. She required little amusement
and was no bother at all. Madam de Alcantara,
on the contrary, proved fussy and exacting.
She led poor Nux a dog&rsquo;s life, waiting on her
whims, and her daughter had no easy time of it
either. Lucia was very dutiful and obedient and
ran at once when summoned by her mother&mdash;which
was every fifteen minutes on a fair average.
Yet the Se&ntilde;ora was quite gracious to all about
her and never lost her temper or said unkind
things. Being as beautiful as she was gracious
we had not the heart to blame her. I believe her
fussiness was a nervous affliction and that the
lady really had a kindly nature. Lucia was devoted
to her and tenderly loved her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>This girl, the third of our female passengers,
was always bright and cheery and the life of the
party. She accepted Alfonso&rsquo;s marked attentions
with absolute indifference. Being accustomed to
them she evidently considered them characteristic
of the boy and to be borne with patience while in
his society. Joe pleased her better; but she was
not the least bit a flirt and had no thought as yet
of falling in love with anyone. Her feeling for
Joe was one of good comradeship.</p>
<p>Little Jim would have been a very decent fellow
could he have modified his airs of importance and
curbed his excessive vanity. He was really a
bright, clever boy, and the son of a man somewhat
distinguished in his own country. But the
youth&rsquo;s patronizing manner was intolerable, and
one evening when he had joined Joe and me and
we were leaning over the rail together I was
obliged to &ldquo;call him down&rdquo; in no gentle manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind associating with you here where
there is no formality, you know,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but
if you ever come to Bogota you must not expect
me to be quite so free with you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>&ldquo;If ever we come to Bogota,&rdquo; I remarked, &ldquo;we
are liable to find you in jail or in hiding among
the mountains. These petty South American revolutions
take queer turns sometimes and are liable
to become dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Petty!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Petty revolutions!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is certainly what they are,&rdquo; I returned.
&ldquo;Your country is so small and insignificant that
we seldom hear of it in the big world; and your
revolution is so absurdly unimportant that we
never hear of it at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you will!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;When we have won
and my father is made president the world will
ring with our victory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;The newspapers in the
United States will give it about an inch of space,
and the people who read that inch will wonder
where on earth Colombia is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He seemed nettled at this, and a little crestfallen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>&ldquo;That inch of publicity,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;you will
perhaps get in case you win. But if you lose you
remain unnoticed. There are lots of Central and
South American republics, and plenty of revolutions
in them at all times. To be frank with you,
Alfonso, the people of more important nations are
weary of reading about them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hardly knew what to reply, but his humiliation
was of short duration. After strutting up
and down the deck a few turns he rejoined us and
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may sneer at Colombia&mdash;and at her great
revolution&mdash;but you cannot sneer at the family of
De Jiminez. We are very ancient.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are, indeed,&rdquo; I assented. &ldquo;You have had
a great many ancestors; but they are mostly dead,
are they not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How far back can you trace <i>your</i> descent?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As far as my father. Those before him we&rsquo;ve
lost track of. They are also dead, and therefore
of no importance to us just now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The family of De Jiminez,&rdquo; he stated proudly,
&ldquo;is very wealthy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why mention so common a thing?&rdquo; I responded.
&ldquo;There are thousands of big fortunes
in the world. Joe Herring, who stands there beside
you and is our second mate, is a millionaire;
yet he lacks distinction on that account because
there happen to be so many other millionaires in
the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned and stared at Joe by the light of the
swinging lantern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You a millionaire!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps a little better than that,&rdquo; admitted
Joe, quietly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a seaman and pretty nearly a
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you have money&mdash;a million?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My agent says it&rsquo;s getting to be nearly twice
that; it grows so tremendously while I&rsquo;m away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why do you sail in a ship as second
mate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mainly because I love the life, and secondly
because I love Sam, here,&rdquo; returned Joe gravely.
&ldquo;The adventure and companionship give me more
pleasure than to pose in a big city as a rich young
kid. As a matter of fact the money is a nuisance
to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you buy a ship of your own and
hire Sam to sail with you?&rdquo; asked Little Jim.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hire Sam! Why Sam is worth more of that
dreadful money than I am. I&rsquo;m sure he could buy
the De Jiminez estates with the bank thrown in
and still be rich.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The statement dazed Alfonso.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it true? Is it possible?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Or are
you joking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; said Joe. &ldquo;The surprising thing is
that you have not heard of the <i>Seagull</i> and its
adventures before this. The ship has made several
fortunes for its owners, and in the United States
and Europe it is famous. But I suppose that inasmuch
as we hear little of the Colombians they hear
little of us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>Alfonso did not try to patronize us so extensively
after this conversation, but he patronized
others and I was sorry he could not remedy so
great a defect in his character. His father was
just as important in his way, but not so officious.
A passion for display in dress and jewelry possessed
the elder De Jiminez and he spent most of
his spare time in changing his clothes, appearing
before us in a succession of dazzling costumes that
made us fairly gasp for breath. He had other
jewels beside the diamonds. Sometimes he wore
rubies, and sometimes emeralds; but he was never
as proud as when sporting his glittering assortment
of diamonds. I think he imagined their
sparkle rendered him personally admirable and the
envy of all beholders, and the poor man never
knew we callous Americans were laughing at him.</p>
<p>Se&ntilde;or de Jiminez was very happy to have succeeded
at last in accomplishing his great mission.
The arms and munitions of war had been secured
with great difficulty and after many disappointments.
Best of all, a ship had been chartered to
carry the stores to Colombia. With such reinforcements
the languishing revolution would receive
new impetus&mdash;sufficient, he fondly hoped, to
render it successful.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER V</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">A SOUTH PACIFIC TYPHOON</span></h2>
<p>Our fine weather held for five days. Then, just
as we were approaching the dangerous district
Captain Steele had spoken of to me, the sky
lowered, a stiff breeze came out of the northwest
and the waves began to pile up as only the waves
of the South Pacific can.</p>
<p>By night it was blowing a gale; but our passengers,
with the exception of Lucia and Alfonso, had
taken to their berths long before this. The <i>Seagull</i>
behaves beautifully in a storm. An ordinary gale
does not disturb her coolness in the least. She
merely tosses her head, takes the bit in her teeth,
so to speak, and prances a trifle instead of gliding.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>But this was no ordinary storm. We who had
experienced all sorts of weather in our voyages
were soon forced to admit that fact. The wind
veered every hour or so; it blew steadily for a
time and then came in gusts&mdash;&ldquo;pushes,&rdquo; Uncle
Naboth called them&mdash;that were exceedingly trying
to both the ship and crew. We would no sooner
find our sea legs on one slant of the deck when
over she flopped and we had to seek a new angle
to cling to. The waves were tremendous and the
wind seized their curling edges and scattered them
in foamy spray over the ship. The sky became
black as ink; the gale roared and shrieked with
maddening intensity; yet we bore it all stolidly
enough for a time, confident of the staunchness of
our bark and the skill of her captain.</p>
<p>My father had put on his pea-jacket and helmet
at the beginning of the storm and kept his station
on deck sturdily. He assured us he knew exactly
where we were and that we had a clear sea ahead
of us; but when the <i>Seagull</i> began to swerve here
and there, driven by the irresistible power of the
gale, even he became bewildered and uncertain of
his bearings.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>All that night the ship fought bravely. It kept
up the fight throughout the long succeeding day.
Perhaps it was because all hands were weary that
the ship seemed to head into the storm of the
second night with less than her usual energy and
spirit.</p>
<p>Drenched to the skin I crept along the deck to
where my father stood. I am no seaman and
have no business on deck at such a time, but I will
own that for the first time in my experience at
sea I had become nervous, and I wanted the captain
to reassure me.</p>
<p>I found him near the bow, clinging to the rail
and trying to peer into the night. He was dripping
with spray and had to wipe his eyes every
few moments to enable him to see at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s everything, father?&rdquo; I asked, my
mouth to his ear.</p>
<p>He shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right if we don&rsquo;t bump something,&rdquo; he
managed to say when a brief lull came. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve
veered an&rsquo; sliced an&rsquo; slipped around so much that
I don&rsquo;t just know where we&rsquo;re at; &rsquo;cept we&rsquo;re way
off our course.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>That was bad; very bad. We hadn&rsquo;t sighted
an island since the storm began, but that was no
evidence we were not near a group of them.
There was a fairly good searchlight aboard the
ship, and it was now being worked every minute
from the lookout; but it couldn&rsquo;t do more on a
night like this than warn us of any near by danger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go back!&rdquo; roared my father in my ear. &ldquo;Go
to bed an&rsquo; save your strength. You may need it
afore long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was the most fearful speech I ever heard
him utter. Nothing had ever disturbed his supreme
confidence before. I crept away heartsick
and awed, and managed to get safely below, where
I found Uncle Naboth smoking his pipe in the
main cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where yer been, Sam?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talking to father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does he say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve lost our bearings and the sea is full of
islands. The ship is all right, you know. It&rsquo;s
only the water that&rsquo;s dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gave a grunt and looked thoughtful.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen gales, &rsquo;n&rsquo; gales,&rdquo; he remarked presently.
&ldquo;Usually they&rsquo;re respectable critters an&rsquo;
you know what to expect of &rsquo;em. But this sort of
a jugglin&rsquo; wind beats all figgerin&rsquo;. Fer me, Sam,
I fall back on our luck. It&rsquo;s stayed by us so far,
an&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t see no reason fer it to change front.
Eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I agree with you, Uncle,&rdquo; I replied, and was
about to add another optimistic remark when in
rushed&mdash;or tumbled, rather&mdash;Se&ntilde;or de Jiminez,
his face white and his teeth chattering. He had
shed his gorgeous raiment and was attired merely
in a dark brown bath robe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; he said, steadying himself by the
table as the ship lurched to leeward, &ldquo;is there&mdash;can
there be&mdash;any danger?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Danger of what?&rdquo; I asked, not knowing just
how to reply to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the cargo&mdash;to the arms!&rdquo; he gasped in
choking tones. Then I saw he was not frightened
about the safety of the people, or even the ship,
but was exercised solely on account of those
precious arms.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, if we go down, the cargo goes with us,&rdquo;
I returned, smiling in spite of the gravity of the
situation. &ldquo;But I imagine we&rsquo;ll all float long
enough to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>Seagull</i> lurched the other way as a great
wave caught her, and while we clung to the furniture
for support there came a sharp crack and
the ship staggered and keeled well over.</p>
<p>She lay there a long time, trembling slightly. I
could hear the waves dash against her with the
force of a trip hammer. The door of the stateroom
opposite flew open and Madam de Alcantara
came rolling into the cabin and landed at my feet.
I managed to seize her and drag her to a chair
beside me; but she clung round my neck sobbing
and crying out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it? Oh, what is it? Are we sinking?
Is all lost?&rdquo; This in Spanish was quite impressive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be calm, Madam,&rdquo; I replied, noticing that she
was robed in a charming dressing gown and had
not been injured by her dash across the cabin
floor. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing serious the matter, you
may be sure.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>I was not really confident of this. Never had
I known the <i>Seagull</i> to behave in such a manner
before. She rolled terribly, and the waves were
dealing her sides thundering blows, one after
another.</p>
<p>Uncle Naboth was endeavoring to gain the door
to get on deck when Joe came in, water running
from his slicker in floods and his face covered
with grease and grime.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up, old man?&rdquo; I demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Screw snapped and tore away the rudder,&rdquo;
said Joe. &ldquo;I was in the engine-room when it
happened. It sent the wheels whirling, I can tell
you, before we could shut down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;re now drifting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If there was any chance at all we could ship a
new rudder. That would serve to keep us
straight, anyhow, and we could use the sails as
soon as the wind moderates. But the gale&rsquo;s as
crazy as a bedbug, and I can&rsquo;t see that anything
can be done just now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing but wait,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trying to lash a rudder to the stern; but it&rsquo;s
hopeless.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>&ldquo;And Ned?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ned&rsquo;s with him, of course. I wanted to help
but they ordered me below.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time all of our passengers had gathered
in the cabin listening to Joe&rsquo;s dismal report. Nux
was there, too, tying Madam de Jiminez fast in a
big chair so she would not fall out and then
tendering his services wherever they were needed.</p>
<p>For a wonder the ship became a bit steadier
now that she was absolutely helpless. She got
into the trough of the sea where the wind did not
buffet her so badly, and although the waves
washed over her constantly she was so tight and
staunch that she shed the water like a duck. I
do not remember ever to have passed a more uneasy
hour than the one that followed the cracking
of the screw and the loss of our rudder. Had it
not been for the women it is likely I would have
regarded our predicament in the light of an adventure,
and been excited and elated over the
danger. But the presence of our female passengers
altered the case entirely and rendered it far
more serious.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>We were a glum lot, if I may except Uncle
Naboth, who still strove to smoke his pipe and
remain philosophic. Alfonso was calm and endeavored
to comfort his father by saying that as
long as we floated the arms were safe. Lucia
devoted herself to her mother with a coolness that
was admirable, and Madam de Jiminez was as
quiet and contented as ever, not making any sort
of a fuss and proving her courage in a way that
quite won us all. I do not know just what
hysterics are; but if they&rsquo;re a sort of a wild fit
that induces one to run amuck, then Madam de
Alcantara had them&mdash;and had them badly. She
screeched, and kicked and howled and wailed that
she was too young to die; although for that matter
she hadn&rsquo;t the advantage of many of us, and
I don&rsquo;t see that youth has any special show in a
South Sea gale, anyhow.</p>
<p>At the end of an hour my father came stumping
in on his wooden leg, looking haggard and weary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brandy, Sam!&rdquo; he said, tumbling into a chair.</p>
<p>I brought him the bottle and a glass and he
took a good swig.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>&ldquo;Bry can&rsquo;t make coffee. The galley&rsquo;s washed
out,&rdquo; continued the captain. And then he drew
his hand across his forehead with a gesture that
I well knew, and that always betokened perturbation
of an unusual sort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you fail to ship the rudder?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t that, Sam. There wasn&rsquo;t much
chance, anyhow. But Billy Burke an&rsquo; Dick Leavenworth
is washed away&mdash;gone&mdash;done for!&rdquo;</p>
<p>My heart gave a thump of dismay. Two of
our finest seamen lost; fellows I had earnestly
respected and admired. It was the first fatality
our crew had ever experienced, so no wonder my
father was broken-hearted over it. I remembered
that Leavenworth had a family, and the thought
made me shudder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ship will the storm stand, and be all good&mdash;will
it not?&rdquo; asked De Jiminez, by this time
thoroughly unstrung and despairing. There was
something almost pitiful in the question&mdash;hoping
against hope&mdash;and of course Captain Steele lied
to reassure him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>Seagull&rsquo;s</i> all right,&rdquo; he asserted. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll
stand a much worse knockin&rsquo; around than this, an&rsquo;
be none the worse for it. You&rsquo;d better all go to
bed an&rsquo; try to sleep. If only we had a clear sea
I&rsquo;d turn in myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it is said we are drifting, Captain! A
propeller we have not; a rudder we have not!
We have no defense against the sea&mdash;we are
impotent&mdash;helpless!&rdquo; wailed De Jiminez.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes; that&rsquo;s a fact,&rdquo; admitted the captain.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re jest like a chip, floatin&rsquo; whichever
way the wind blows. But you never heard of a
chip sinkin&rsquo;, did you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;N&mdash;no,&rdquo; was the doubting reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by saying there&rsquo;s not a
clear sea?&rdquo; asked young Alfonso.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Study yer jogerfy,&rdquo; said my father gruffly.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find the South Seas specked with islands
everywheres. I don&rsquo;t jest know where we are at
this minute, but I&rsquo;ll gamble there&rsquo;s islands not
far away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh. Then if the ship happens to break up we
can easily get to land, and perhaps save the
cargo,&rdquo; remarked Little Jim complacently.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>My father stared at him, muttered some inaudible
remark and rose to return to the deck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must you go?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my place, Sam,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll be careful?&rdquo; I never said such a
thing to him before, but I had poor Dick and
Billy Burke in my mind&mdash;cautious fellows, both
of them&mdash;and my father had a wooden leg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll lash myself to the riggin&rsquo; when I get to
it,&rdquo; he returned, and disappeared up the companionway.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>We sat in dismal silence for a time. The wind
seemed to be abating, but the waves continued
their mad rolling as vigorously as ever. Finally
Madam de Jiminez expressed a wish to return to
her stateroom. Nux understood Spanish, for our
blacks were marvels at acquiring languages and
could speak half a dozen tongues; so the steward
assisted the old lady to her berth and made her
as comfortable as possible. After a long argument
Lucia prevailed upon her mother to go to
bed, and the moaning, despairing woman was led
to her room. Perhaps inspired by this example
Uncle Naboth decided to &ldquo;turn in,&rdquo; but the two
De Jiminez stuck it out and remained all night in
the cabin, deploring their hard luck in choicest
Spanish. As much to escape their moody companionship
as anything else I went to my own
room and lay down upon the bunk without removing
my clothing. It was then about three
o&rsquo;clock, and although the motion of the vessel had
greatly moderated I found it no easy task to stay
in my berth. Being at the mercy of the waves the
<i>Seagull</i> performed some queer antics, and once
or twice I wondered if she wouldn&rsquo;t &ldquo;turn
turtle,&rdquo; so far over did the waves keel her. But,
queerly enough, we get used to anything in time,
and as I was much exhausted I finally fell into a
doze, and then into a deep slumber.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">A FREAKISH SHIPWRECK</span></h2>
<p>Joe wakened me at early dawn, laying a wet,
clammy hand in mine and jerking me to a sitting
position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get up, Sam!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Something&rsquo;s going
to happen pretty quick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are we leaking?&rdquo; I asked as I tumbled from
the berth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; but that isn&rsquo;t it. Come on deck; and
step lively while you&rsquo;ve got the chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rushed away with the words and I followed
him closely.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>The sky was gray and overcast, and although
it was so early there was light enough to observe
distinctly our surroundings. The waves were
simply gigantic and the disabled <i>Seagull</i> was like
a fisherman&rsquo;s bob in their grasp. The cargo had
not shifted, fortunately, owing to its being so
heavy and so carefully stowed, so we kept on our
keel as well as the sea would allow us. I found
nothing terrifying in the view from the deck until
my eye caught sight of a dark object looming
ahead, which I instantly recognized as the rocky
shore of an island. The waves were bearing us
rapidly toward it, and we were helpless to resist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See there! and there!&rdquo; cried Joe, pointing to
right and left.</p>
<p>I saw. Rocks were everywhere, on all sides of
us. We were right in the heart of a group of
South Sea islands&mdash;what group, we had no idea.
My father&rsquo;s stern, set face showed from the poop;
the sailors stood motionless at the rail. The two
De Jiminez, father and son, clung together and
stared with blanched faces at the threatening
coast.</p>
<p>There was scarcely any wind, as we were partially
sheltered in this location. A wind might
possibly have saved us; but as it was, and in our
crippled condition, there was absolutely no hope.</p>
<p>Uncle Naboth stumbled toward us and said to
Joe:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>&ldquo;Call the passengers. Get &rsquo;em all on deck an&rsquo;
see that there are plenty of life preservers. Ned&rsquo;s
getting the boats ready to launch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I went with Joe, for there was nothing I could
do on deck. Madam de Alcantara began to scream
again, but she was not slow in grabbing her
jewels and gaining the deck, where she collapsed
at once and sobbed like a baby. We got the old
lady up easily, and she was as cheerful as anyone
could be under such trying circumstances. I had
Lucia search for all the cloaks and warm clothing
she could lay hands on and Joe and I brought up
a lot of blankets; for the air was chilly, even in
this tropical clime, and I knew we would all be
soaked if we managed to get ashore in the boats.</p>
<p>Bryonia provided a lot of food for us&mdash;tinned
meats, biscuits and various edibles that might be
eaten uncooked&mdash;and had the forethought to add
some utensils for cooking, as well. A keg of fresh
water was deposited in each of the boats. By
this time the grim island ahead was very near, and
Captain Steele shouted his orders to have the boats
lowered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>We put the women into the first, while it still
swung at the davits, and Ned Britton, cool as a
cucumber, picked a crew to man it. He watched
his chance and dropped the longboat neatly on
the crest of a high wave, casting loose as the ship
rolled heavily in the opposite direction. A little
cheer arose from our men as they saw Ned&rsquo;s boat
floating safely, and at once Joe began loading the
gig. The two De Jiminez and Uncle Naboth were
with this lot; but Joe was not so fortunate as Ned
had been. He dropped the boat all right into the
gulf between two big waves, but a line got tangled,
somehow, and in a jiffy the gig was over and her
occupants struggling frantically in the water. The
boatswain dropped the third boat quick as a flash,
got free from the ship and began picking up the
swimmers. Ned also came to the rescue, at the
peril of capsizing his own frail craft, and he drew
Little Jim aboard as the boy was sinking for the
third time. His father was hauled in by a boat
hook wielded by the sturdy boatswain, and fortunately
Uncle Naboth was spilled so close to the
side that he was able to seize a rope and hold fast
until rescued. Not a life was lost and the third
boat, the cutter, carried its double load easily.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>There remained to us but one more boat to
launch, and I went to my father and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, sir; there&rsquo;s nothing to be gained by
waiting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get aboard, Sam,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and take all the
men that&rsquo;s left with you. I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to stay here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that is folly!&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a useless
sacrifice, father. You can&rsquo;t help the poor <i>Seagull</i>
by staying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my ship&mdash;part o&rsquo; her, anyhow&mdash;an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll
stay by her like she&rsquo;s always stayed by me,&rdquo; he
returned obstinately.</p>
<p>I was in despair and for a moment knew not
what to do. Turning half around I found the two
big blacks, Nux and Bryonia, standing just behind
me. The remaining sailors were already in
the boat, looking anxiously towards us.</p>
<p>I caught Bry&rsquo;s eye and there was an inquiring
look in it that could not be misunderstood.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>&ldquo;Take him, boys!&rdquo; I exclaimed, and at the word
the two promptly caught my father up and bore
him kicking and struggling to the boat, where
they dumped him on the bottom and then sat upon
him.</p>
<p>The lines were quickly cast off and we floated
squarely upon the brow of a wave. The men at
the oars pulled lustily and we increased our distance
from the ship with steady strokes. They
then lay to, merely trying to keep a balance as we
slid down the side of one wave and up the slope
of another.</p>
<p>I had my eyes fastened on the <i>Seagull</i>, and
presently a huge mountain of water came sweeping
along, caught her full on its crest and rushed
with her upon the rocks of the island, now very
near to us.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>The ship went ashore stern foremost, upright
as a die and riding the top of the great wave like
a swan. It tucked her into a cove between two
elevated points of rock and then receded and left
her perched there. There was no crash of splintering
timbers&mdash;no sound at all. The foremast
swayed, cracked off and tumbled over the side; but
the other masts stood firmly and it seemed to our
wondering eyes as if some monster had grabbed
the ship from the sea and set it high on the rocks
to dry. Our oarsmen had plenty to do just then
to keep us from swamping, for although we were
not directly in the track of the monster wave we
were near enough to feel a portion of its resistless
power and were nearly sucked in upon the
reefs ourselves. But I shouted as frantically as a
madman, and from the other boats, which were
at the right of us, arose a hearty cheer that made
our seamen pause long enough to stare over their
shoulders at the marvelous sight. Then they
cheered too, for we all loved the dear old <i>Seagull</i>.</p>
<p>Instead of a wreck&mdash;the fatal smash-up that had
seemed imminent and was expected by all&mdash;the
good ship was suddenly rendered safe from further
harm, for no other wave that followed was
powerful enough to dislodge her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>Nux and Bryonia allowed the captain to sit up
to view the wonderful sight, and my father stared
until his eyes bulged from their sockets. He said
nothing, however, but turned his attention to our
personal dilemma, for there was no surety that we
could manage to gain the shore alive. A forbidding
line of rocky reefs faced us and should we
attempt to land among them our frail boats would
be instantly dashed to pieces. Bryonia, who had
stood up to look at the ship when he released my
father, remained for some time upright, shading
his eyes with his hand and peering attentively at
the coast. Presently he gave a grunt and muttered
something to Nux in their native language.
I caught the words, for long ago they had taught
me, merely as a pastime, their peculiar dialect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Faytan!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Look, Ketaha, is it not
so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ketaha was Nux&rsquo;s original name, never used
since Uncle Naboth had picked him up. He too
stared at the coast line steadily, and then nodded
his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be Faytan, my Louiki. Perhaps we are
wrong. But it surely looks like Faytan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know this island, then?&rdquo; I asked,
speaking their own language.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>&ldquo;If it is Faytan, we have been very near to it;
but we have never landed upon the island,&rdquo; replied
Bry. &ldquo;The Pearl People live in Faytan, and they
are the enemies of all the other islanders&mdash;of all
the world. If it is Faytan, we are risking our
lives to land there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is risking our lives to try to keep afloat in
this sea,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;Our men cannot fight these
waves for long, Bry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned away and whispered to Nux. After
a brief confab the latter said to us in English:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jus&rsquo; try to turn dat point o&rsquo; rock yonder,
Cap&rsquo;n Steele. Den I guess you find a cove to
land, where dere am no rocks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The English of the blacks was somewhat imperfect,
although they spoke their own language
with excellent expression. But you must remember
they had acquired our language on shipboard,
from all classes of people, and seamen are
not noted for grammatical precision.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>Captain Steele at once took command of our
boat and directed the men to pull around the point
of rock. They obeyed with a will and, although
they found it a desperately hard task in such a
raging sea, finally succeeded in breasting the waves
and making the point. Immediately we found
ourselves sheltered from the force of the waves
and, sure enough, a strip of white sand lined the
shore of a small cove just ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Faytan!&rdquo; cried Bry, and covered his face with
his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Faytan!&rdquo; echoed Nux; but he frowned and
said nothing more.</p>
<p>The other boats had followed our lead and,
heavily laden though they were, managed to round
the point. Within half an hour we had run all
three boats upon the tiny beach, pulled them out
of reach of the sea, and stood wet and despondent
in a dismal group upon this unknown isle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE PEARL PEOPLE</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;This is a terrible experience,&rdquo; said De Jiminez
in a gloomy voice. &ldquo;A nation&rsquo;s fate has been
decided by a South Sea typhoon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All is not lost,&rdquo; replied Little Jim, attempting
to console him. &ldquo;The ship is high on the rocks
yonder, and all the arms and ammunition may
yet be saved. Perhaps the natives of this island
are civilized and friendly, and will care for us
until we can find another ship to take us to
Colombia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His father shook his head disconsolately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt if any people at all live on these rocks,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;The place seems absolutely barren.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, there is a grove of big trees a quarter of
a mile back,&rdquo; declared Alfonso, &ldquo;and the island is
surely big enough to support many inhabitants.
Wherever there are trees we are likely to find
fields of grain and fruits. Come; let us go inland
and explore the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During this conversation the three women had
huddled under their wet cloaks, terrified and
trembling. To them this adventure was a dreadful
thing. To be shipwrecked upon a barren
island is not wholly unknown to mankind but may
well be regarded at all times with foreboding and
horror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, then,&rdquo; said the elder De Jiminez; &ldquo;let
us walk to the forest yonder. We shall find better
shelter there, if nothing more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a moment, please!&rdquo; I exclaimed, for I
had been watching Bryonia and Nux, who stood
apart eagerly conversing together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should we wait?&rdquo; demanded Alfonso,
annoyed at my interference.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because these blacks are natives of the South
Seas,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;and they think they recognize
this island. Let us therefore counsel with them
before we act.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah! Any of these islands is safe enough,&rdquo;
persisted the boy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am not sure of that,&rdquo; I responded. &ldquo;We are
far from the usual path of ships as we have been
blown from our course by the gale. This island
is not marked upon any chart, I am sure, which
means that there is no record of a white man
having ever visited it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This statement had its influence upon our passengers,
for they cast uneasy glances around and
I am sure De Jiminez had no desire to risk the
safety of the women by acting recklessly.</p>
<p>Presently our blacks came toward us with grave
faces. Bryonia approached my father and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We pretty sure this Faytan Island, the home
of the cruel Pearl People. If that is so, we no
safe here, and better go away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, and leave the <i>Seagull</i>!&rdquo; exclaimed my
father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If no go away,&rdquo; returned Bry in solemn tones,
&ldquo;we soon be dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>&ldquo;Pearl People never let people come to their
island. If people come, they kill &rsquo;em quick. Nux
and I, we once live on island near here. Twice the
young men of my people make a war party to
conquer Pearl People. The first time none ever
came back. The second time Nux and I we go
with them. We have many hundred fighting men&mdash;warriors.
We come to other side of island,
where is big city. Pearl People see us and send
many hundred boats to meet us on the water.
We make brave fight. All our warriors die. Nux
and me, we bound and put in bottom of canoe.
Pearl People king say he take us to city and kill
us with fire to honor his great Pearl God, who
win him the fight. But sudden storm come up;
very bad storm; our boat break away and drift
out to sea; we nearly die from thirst and pain
when you pick us up and save us. That the story
of the Pearl People. They very bad, cruel blacks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bry&rsquo;s dramatic recital gave us all food for
thought, as may well be imagined. The sailors
and passengers formed an eager group around
him and listened intently to the tale; but there
was little of comfort in it for anyone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>Uncle Naboth, my father and I, Joe and Ned
Britton, went a little apart from the others and
held a council. After considering the situation
we favored Joe&rsquo;s advice, which was to cut across
the end of the island to where the <i>Seagull</i> was
perched upon the rocks, enter the ship and take
possession of it before our enemies did. We
could be more comfortable there than elsewhere
on this bleak shore. Our supplies were there,
probably uninjured; moreover, we could use it as
a fort and defend it successfully against a horde
if attacked.</p>
<p>If Bry and Nux were correct about this being
Faytan, then this was the safest plan we could
adopt. If our blacks were wrong we would soon
discover the fact and could later decide on a
definite plan of action.</p>
<p>It would be impossible to launch the boats
again and return around the point to the ship, for
the sea was yet in fearful turmoil; so we decided
to leave the boats where they were, and try to find
our way across the rocks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>Our passengers, when this was explained to
them, readily agreed to the plan, provided the
ship proved to be in a safe position and we were
able to get aboard. Of course our crew, all old
and tried men, were ready to obey any orders
they received, so we lost no time in making the
start and our promptness doubtless saved our
lives.</p>
<p>There was a gloomy sky and the wind howled
mournfully among the rocks. We appointed two
men to assist Madam de Jiminez and two others
to aid Madam de Alcantara who, since a real
calamity had befallen us, had ceased to wail and
settled into a state of helpless stupor. Alfonso
and Joe walked with Lucia, but the girl was fully
as active as they were and could climb the rocks
like a mountain goat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>There was a fairly level country between the
forest and the cove, but in order to reach the ship
we had to clamber over a mass of jagged rocks
that proved exceedingly difficult. There were high
peaks with deep ravines between them, for the
point we were crossing was of volcanic formation
and some eruption had tossed the huge stones
helter-skelter in a confused mass. At one time
we were high enough to see the ocean&mdash;still rolling
wildly&mdash;and at its feet the dear old <i>Seagull</i>
perched like a monument on the rocks. Then we
got tangled up with the ravines again and when
next we emerged we were across the point, and
only a hundred rods or so from the jagged coast
where the ship was.</p>
<p>It was a marvelous thing, this high beaching of
the <i>Seagull</i>. The wave that carried her ashore
must have been a monster, for the ship stood at
least twenty feet above the water level and she
had been gently placed between two huge rocks
in a cavity that seemed especially made to receive
her. She stood level as a die, stern to the island
and bow to the sea&mdash;the sea that she was likely
never to sail again; for no human agency could
ever launch her from that altitude, with a double
row of sharp reefs between her and the deep
water. As a seagoing vessel we admitted that the
career of the <i>Seagull</i> was ended; but as a place of
refuge&mdash;a residence and a fort&mdash;the ship in its
present location would prove invaluable to us as
long as we were obliged to remain upon the island.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>We found the rocks that supported her so steep
and difficult to climb that we sent Joe and Ned
Britton ahead, they being as sure-footed as cats.
On reaching the ship they found only a loose rope
hanging over the side to enable them to get
aboard; but Joe managed to mount by this means
and at once let down a ladder. A few minutes
sufficed to gather ropes enough for their purpose,
which was to furnish something to assist us in
mounting to the ship. It was not easy to get the
two ladies up, but Lucia was as active as a boy
and assisted her mother even better than we could.</p>
<p>Soon we were all aboard, and to us who had
always trod the decks when the <i>Seagull</i> lay upon
the bosom of the water it was a peculiar experience
to find her stationary and wedged tight between
two big rocks. There was more or less
disorder on board, as was natural when you consider
we had deserted the ship in a panic of fear;
but there seemed no especial damage of any port
and the men set to work and quickly put things to
rights again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>The sea was falling rapidly. After we reached
the ship there was no wave of sufficient magnitude
to dash the spray over her side, and few that even
wetted her. The passengers at once sought their
staterooms and put them in order for further
occupancy. De Jiminez was delighted at the
thought that he had saved his precious cargo, although
what good the guns and truck could do
the revolution in Colombia was a mystery to the
rest of us. Little Jim was in a sullen, silent mood
and seemed to think fate was playing him a sorry
trick. Perhaps she was; but my opinion is we
were lucky to come out of the typhoon as well as
we did. It was assuredly the worst storm I have
ever experienced.</p>
<p>So far we had seen no natives at all, and Uncle
Naboth said to Bryonia:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;re mistaken about this being the
island of the Pearl People. For if them natives
you&rsquo;ve described are as careful as you say they
are about guarding their coast, they would have
been after us long before this.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>&ldquo;We quite sure we right,&rdquo; answered Bry. &ldquo;But
you see, in such storm as this they think no natives
of other islands can come here to attack, so they
stay at home in their big city. To-morrow they
come here, plenty of them; and then we must fight
hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This set my father thinking. He turned to Ned
Britton and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you s&rsquo;pose we could get the boats around
to-night? The sea&rsquo;s easier now and if we wait
till to-morrow we may have the natives on us.
We can&rsquo;t very well afford to lose the boats, for
without &rsquo;em we&rsquo;d have no way to leave this
island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ned cast a look over the water and then nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Cap&rsquo;n,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll try it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went away to pick his men, and Bry returned
to the kitchen galley and started dinner.
Fortunately the <i>Seagull</i> was well provisioned and
we had enough supplies to last our party for
several months.</p>
<p>As Nux was laying the cabin table for the
noonday meal I said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are the natives of Faytan called the
Pearl People&mdash;and why should your tribe make
such a desperate effort to conquer them?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Roun&rsquo; dis island, Mars Sam,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is de
fines&rsquo; pearls in all de world. Dey grow in a
certain sort o&rsquo; clamshell what can&rsquo;t be foun&rsquo; anywhere
else. An&rsquo; de Faytan natives dey jus&rsquo; crazy
&rsquo;bout dem pearls, an&rsquo; fish fer &rsquo;em all de time. But
dey won&rsquo;t sell none nor give &rsquo;em away; dey jus&rsquo;
keeps &rsquo;em all heaped up in de Pearl City, an&rsquo; wears
&rsquo;em on deyre bodies fer orn&rsquo;ments. Dey worship
de pearls in de great temple an&rsquo; believes dey gives
&rsquo;em strength an&rsquo; health an&rsquo; makes &rsquo;em defeat all
deyre enemies. If any boat comes here an&rsquo; sends
anyone ashore dey kill &rsquo;em quick. Sometimes de
tribes of other islands come in big numbers to try
to get de pearls; but Faytans always too strong
for &rsquo;em an&rsquo; kill &rsquo;em all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then how do you know about the pearls, and
the Pearl City, and the Pearl Temple, and all
that?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How we know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. If no one ever gets away alive, how did
you find out about these people?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you,&rdquo; said Nux. &ldquo;Bry&rsquo;s father he great
chief of our people&mdash;what you call king. One
day when he go with many canoe to fight the
Grinto Islanders, a storm come up an&rsquo; drive him
far away. All de canoe keep together with lines,
an&rsquo; lay still on de water all night, floatin&rsquo; wherever
de wind drive &rsquo;em. When day break in
mornin&rsquo; he find two canoe from Faytan have drift
in among &rsquo;em. When Faytan people see our
canoe dey go fast to escape; but our warriors go
faster. Dey catch Faytan canoe an&rsquo; de Pearl
People fight us. Dey kill twenty-two of our
warriors an&rsquo; we kill six Faytan people an&rsquo; make
two prisoners. The prisoners we carry back home.
Dey big fellows an&rsquo; don&rsquo;t talk much; but dey brag
of de Pearl People an&rsquo; say they rich an&rsquo; strong,
an&rsquo; nobody can ever conquer dem an&rsquo; get de
pearls. Sometimes dey tell us all about de Pearl
City an&rsquo; de great temple, an&rsquo; all dat; an&rsquo; our chief
ask &rsquo;em to show de way to Faytan an&rsquo; he prove he
can conquer de Pearl People. Dey tell chief dey
hate us so bad dey will show de way. So many
young men of our tribe go in canoe, an&rsquo; de two
Faytan natives go an&rsquo; show dem de way. I guess
&rsquo;bout four hundred went, but only seven came
back. All de res&rsquo; was murdered by de Pearl
People. De prisoners try to escape in de fight an&rsquo;
get to land; but our chief he kill &rsquo;em both an&rsquo; den
escape himself an&rsquo; come home with six others.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>&ldquo;That was hard luck,&rdquo; I remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father,&rdquo; said Nux, &ldquo;was kill in dat fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you tried it again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many years after. Chief he old, den, an&rsquo; his
son grow up an&rsquo; want to go to Faytan. De chief&rsquo;s
son is Bry. He my cousin. We hear much talk
about Pearl People, an&rsquo; Bry&mdash;his right name
Louiki&mdash;he beg chief to go. So we get a thousan&rsquo;
warriors with spear, ax an&rsquo; bow &rsquo;n&rsquo; arrow, and
go in many canoe to Faytan. Bry told you what
happen. I think we two the only ones that
escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I thought over this story with much care.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you believe all that rubbish about the
pearls, Nux?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why not, Mars Sam? I see de Pearl People
when I fight &rsquo;em. All have their bodies covered
wid strings of fine pearls. Big pearls. Some
white, some blue, some pink. I see de pearls.
Why do I not believe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see the big city?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see part of it from de sea. We couldn&rsquo;t get
on shore. It mighty fine city, Mars Sam&mdash;over
on de odder side dis island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then how did you happen to recognize the
back end of the island where we are now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before we fight we come close, in de night, to
see if we can land here an&rsquo; not be seen. We think
if we can fight on land we beat de Faytans, who
fight best on water. But when we row up an&rsquo;
down dis coast we find we cannot land. We try
de little cove; but dey on watch. Dey on watch
all aroun&rsquo; de island; so we go bold to de front an&rsquo;
fight in sight of de city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems to me, Nux,&rdquo; I observed, turning this
over in my mind, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re likely to have some
lively times with these natives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The black nodded very soberly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>&ldquo;Pearl People very big; very dang&rsquo;rous,&rdquo; he
replied. &ldquo;They thick as leaves on the trees. If
we go &rsquo;way alive, Mars Sam, it&rsquo;s cause we have a
ship full o&rsquo; guns an&rsquo; ca&rsquo;tridges, which shoot better
than bow &rsquo;n&rsquo; arrow can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; I said, smiling; &ldquo;it is certainly
fortunate we have such a cargo. And the ship,
cast ashore in this place, is a splendid fort. We
won&rsquo;t despair yet, Nux.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ladies did not appear at dinner, all three
having gone to bed to rest after their dreadful
night. Nux carried coffee and toast to them, and
the rest of us dined at the cabin table in rather
solemn fashion. There was little in the situation
to cheer any of us.</p>
<p>Toward evening Ned and his men left the ship
and began their tedious climb over the rocky point
to the cove where we had left the boats. I saw
that all of them were well armed and warned
them of the warlike disposition of the natives.
The sea was now smooth enough to render the
journey around by boat practical, and as we had
seen no sign of any inhabitants, so far, we hoped
we were as yet unobserved. But that thick forest
ahead of us might be harboring a hundred watching
eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>They failed to discover themselves, in that case,
then or afterward. It grew dark quickly and I
feared our boys would not reach the boats until
long after nightfall. But the sky was clearing, in
patches, and in places we could see thousands of
stars glittering dimly.</p>
<p>We had established a good watch on deck and
drawn up all the ladders, so that a surprise was
well-nigh impossible. Joe and I paced up and
down in the dusk, for we were careful not to show
any lights, and talked about the queer stories we
had heard of the Pearl People.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If half these tales are true, Joe,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I
mean to have a try at some of those pearls before
we leave here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he returned. &ldquo;It would be foolish
for us not to land such a rare treasure when it&rsquo;s
right at hand&mdash;hunting for us, so to speak. But
what interests me most, Sam, is the Pearl City,
with its palaces and temples. That might be
worth seeing.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nux says the natives number many thousands,
and they have decreed death to all strangers. But
who knows, Joe? We may see the city after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he was about to reply we heard the far-off
crack of rifles&mdash;a regular volley&mdash;and knew the
sound came from the cove. After that there was
deep silence.</p>
<p>The struggle had begun.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE REEF PATROL</span></h2>
<p>Because no sound of any sort now came to our
ears we were beginning to worry about the fate
of our men when Bry joined us on deck. He said
the Faytans did not shout when they fought.
They uttered no war cry of any sort, but went
into battle silently and if slain died without a
murmur. Victory was accepted with the same
stoicism, so it was impossible for us to tell how
the battle had gone. That Ned Britton&rsquo;s party
had met the natives there was no doubt. The
shots told us that. Only time could disclose the
result.</p>
<p>My father and Uncle Naboth had come on
deck and soon young Alfonso joined our anxious
group.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>&ldquo;I hope your men didn&rsquo;t provoke a battle with
the islanders,&rdquo; said the latter. &ldquo;My father and I
depend on them for assistance in getting away
from here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be glad to assist you to get to glory,&rdquo;
replied Uncle Naboth, &ldquo;for that&rsquo;s their best stunt.
Haven&rsquo;t you been told these Faytans, or Pearl
People, as our blacks call &rsquo;em, decree death to
any who land on this island?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s Nux&rsquo;s story; but I don&rsquo;t believe
it,&rdquo; said the boy. &ldquo;When we tell them who we
are they&rsquo;ll be sure to treat us decently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose they&rsquo;ve ever heard of
Colombia?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; he retorted. &ldquo;They must have
some intercourse with the outside world. Ships
visit every known island, nowadays.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt if a ship has ever been here before,&rdquo;
said I. &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t a known island; it&rsquo;s not on
any map or chart or other record. There are
plenty of such islands in the South Seas, I suppose.
Bryonia and Nux happen to know this
place, for their own native island is only about a
hundred leagues away; but my father and uncle,
who have sailed all the traveled paths in the
South Pacific, have never heard of Faytan
before.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>Alfonso became silent at this; but he remained
on deck, and it was after midnight before our
anxiety was satisfied.</p>
<p>Ned&rsquo;s signal came as a joyful surprise to us,
and we hastily threw down the ladders and ropes
to assist the fugitives in gaining the deck, in case
they were pursued. The mate leaped on board
first of all, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let down the davits; and lively, too, lads!
We&rsquo;ve got the boats; but Lord only knows what
else we&rsquo;ve brought with us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>In the hurry that followed no questions were
asked. It was better to work first and talk afterward.
The davits were swung out and the ropes
lowered; but after that it was some time before
we got the first signal to haul away, for the men
had to carry the heavy boats up the slanting rocks
before they could be attached. Pretty soon the
longboat came swinging up; then the gig, and
finally the cutter. We had lost the fourth boat,
the whaler, in launching it in the storm, but all
the boats left on the shore of the cove, with their
contents, were now secured. We had to work by
the light of the stars, which was dim enough; for
until the boats and all the men were under shelter
we dared not show a light.</p>
<p>Finally three of our men were hoisted over the
side moaning with pain. These were tenderly
received by their fellows and stowed below, while
Bry, the best surgeon on the ship, hurried after to
see what could be done for them. When we got
Ned into the cabin to spin his yarn we found his
left hand covered with a bloodsoaked bandage torn
from his shirt, yet he had been working so industriously
we had not suspected he was wounded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>&ldquo;We got to the cove, all right,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;though it were a bitter climb over them sharp
rocks. We didn&rsquo;t wait a minute after gett&rsquo;n&rsquo;
thar, but run the boats down the beach into deep
water an&rsquo; prepared to get away at once. Part of
us were still waist deep in the water an&rsquo; the others
gett&rsquo;n&rsquo; the oars shipped, when without warnin&rsquo; a
hail of arrers fell among us. It was dark, a&rsquo;most,
but when I glanced at the shore I could see the
white sand covered with scores o&rsquo; black natives;
so I knew our first move was to dig out lively.
Yaller Tom were bleedin&rsquo; beside me in the water,
an&rsquo; I had to pull an arrer out&rsquo;n my own hand
afore I could help him; but in a jiffy we were
aboard an&rsquo; rowin&rsquo; like mad. The arrers kept
fallin&rsquo; &rsquo;round us, but didn&rsquo;t do any more damage,
so afore we got out o&rsquo; rifle range I let the boys
drop oars an&rsquo; fire one round into that black line
o&rsquo; savages. Some of &rsquo;em must have dropped, but
they never give a whimper; so we rowed on agin
an&rsquo; soon lost sight of &rsquo;em. The waves rolled us
&rsquo;round some, for the storm left a heavy swell, an&rsquo;
to keep from grindin&rsquo; on the reefs we had to pick
our way mighty careful. There ain&rsquo;t no decent
water anywhere near this ship, an&rsquo; at first I
thought we&rsquo;d never get the boats to it; but a mile
or so north we found an openin&rsquo; in the first reef,
an&rsquo; half a mile or so south o&rsquo; here we got through
the second reef. We had to keep quiet, for fear
the savages had followed us along the shore, so
they could drop on us when we tried to land; but
they failed to connect. Seen anything of &rsquo;em?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Uncle Naboth. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s hurt,
Ned, besides yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess Yaller Tom is done fer. The arrer&rsquo;s
broke off in his chest an&rsquo; he wouldn&rsquo;t let us pull
it out. Nicodemus Brown&rsquo;s got a splinter through
his shoulder, an&rsquo; young Dipps got an ugly gash
in the leg. That&rsquo;s the worst o&rsquo; the story, although
several of us&rsquo;ll carry scars to remind us of this
night&rsquo;s work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you owe your escape to the
fact that the natives had no canoes on this end of
the island. They must have discovered you while
you were climbing the point, but got to the cove
just a little too late to meet you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said Captain Steele, &ldquo;it would have
been a more even fight if you could have faced
them on land.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m satisfied as it was,&rdquo; returned Ned, shaking
his head doubtfully. &ldquo;They were thick as
fleas, Cap&rsquo;n, an&rsquo; if we hadn&rsquo;t got away in the
boats when we did we could have shot &rsquo;em down
till our cartridges give out, an&rsquo; then there&rsquo;d have
been enough left to have murdered us neat an&rsquo;
quiet. We must get ready for them folks, sir;
they&rsquo;re sure to be on us in the mornin&rsquo;, if they
don&rsquo;t arrive sooner. But I count myself lucky to
have got back with the boats with no worse
calamities than we really had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; said my father. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m much
obliged, Ned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I went to the forecastle to inquire about the
wounded. Bry looked grave over Yellow Tom&rsquo;s
case, but said the others would quickly recover.
Our islander knew all about arrow wounds, such
as these, and could treat them more successfully
than a regular surgeon might have done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose the arrows were poisoned?&rdquo;
I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;South Sea natives do not
poison arrows. We leave that to the Negritos of
the Philippines and inland tribes of Australia.
We islanders fight like men, not like cowards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear we shall find plenty of fighting ahead
of us,&rdquo; I remarked, rather gloomily.</p>
<p>The black nodded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>&ldquo;If we stay here we must fight,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I
think it better to take the women away in the
boats, and trust the sea. From here I am sure I
can find the way to my own island, where I am a
chief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I made no comment on this suggestion and
returned thoughtfully to the deck. I knew
Bryonia&rsquo;s advice was sound enough; but I hated
to leave without an attempt to see the Pearl City
and get some of the big pearls I had heard of.
The result proved, however, that we could not
have taken to the boats had we decided to.</p>
<p>We kept an alert watch that night, you may be
sure, but not a sound did we hear except the
sullen roar of the breakers against the reefs. As
dawn broke the lookout made a discovery. About
a quarter of a mile away, between the first and
second reefs, was a solid line of canoes, each
carrying from three to six native Faytans. This
line extended from the point to half a mile down
the coast, and the patrol so established was sufficient
to render our escape in the boats impossible.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>There was no sign of activity among the
natives. They sat stolidly in their canoes, their
eyes bent upon the ship, perched high before them,
and these sentries were destined to remain at
their posts for many days to come.</p>
<p>Now that we were discovered we experienced a
feeling of relief. Whatever might happen from
this time on we could accept calmly and with our
eyes wide open. It was no game of hide and
seek, but open defiance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose we must accept this as a declaration
of war,&rdquo; remarked Se&ntilde;or de Jiminez at the breakfast
table. The ladies had all risen early to go
on deck and examine the canoe patrol, so for
once we were a complete assemblage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly is no peaceful demonstration,&rdquo; I
replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still, we may be able to treat with them and
peace establish,&rdquo; continued the Colombian.
&ldquo;Let us offer to give them a few guns if they will
let us go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I noticed Nux grinning in a corner of the cabin
and was at once reminded of the humor of the
suggestion advanced.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do they know about guns, Nux?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Mars Sam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they did,&rdquo; I asserted, &ldquo;they&rsquo;d realize their
ability to capture all we have. But I understand
these people never treat with intruders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We did not mean to intrude!&rdquo; exclaimed
Madam de Alcantara in a frightened voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; it was forced upon us,&rdquo; I agreed. &ldquo;I
wonder if these fellows, to whom a ship like ours
is unknown, are not amazed to find the <i>Seagull</i>
set high upon the rocks of their coast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All savage tribes,&rdquo; remarked Se&ntilde;or de Jiminez,
reverting to the former subject, &ldquo;are said to deal
with foreigners as they are dealt with. These
people may be inimical to other native tribes, who
sometimes come to fight and rob them, but it
seems to me if we treat them politely they will
become friendly in return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may try it, if you like,&rdquo; said Uncle
Naboth dryly. &ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t wait to discover
whether Ned Britton&rsquo;s party were polite or not;
they jest shot &rsquo;em up an&rsquo; asked no questions.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo; wailed Madam de Alcantara.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure we shall all be murdered by these
heathen brutes. Why&mdash;oh, why&mdash;did I ever sail
on your ill-fated ship!&rdquo; and the poor lady began
to shed real tears.</p>
<p>Lucia&rsquo;s mother had a weak character, in spite
of her proud and haughty airs when safe ashore
in a civilized community. Any adverse fortune
floored her at once and I am sure she had already
suffered agonies such as ordinary death could not
equal. Her daughter, attentive and sympathetic
in a charming, unobtrusive way, sought to console
and encourage her parent; but it was a hopeless
task. The sight of the natives had completely
unnerved Madam de Alcantara, and she sobbed so
bitterly that Lucia had to lead her to her room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>Madam de Jiminez had nothing to say. She
seldom asked a question, and knowing she would
be cared for as well as circumstances would permit,
showed us always a benign and cheerful face.
She was never in the way, and we all so admired
the old lady&rsquo;s courage that she suffered no lack
of attention. The one beautiful thing about her
son and grandson was the devotion they lavished
upon her. Selfish they might be in all other ways,
but both were willing at all times to sacrifice their
pleasure to insure her comfort. Misadventures
such as this are sure to bring out the good and
bad in one&rsquo;s nature, and we learned to gauge one
another quite correctly during this period of
mutual danger and suffering.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>On gaining the deck after breakfast we found
that the idea of turning the ship into a fort was
being carried out in a practical manner. We
always carried a supply of rifles and cutlasses in
the gun room, in case of an emergency such as
this. These had been brought out and distributed
lavishly along the deck, where one could conveniently
seize them. We had plenty of ammunition
without having recourse to the revolutionary
supplies, and we judged that from the shelter of
our bulwarks we could repel any horde of savages
attempting to clamber up the rocks. Even if we
allowed them to reach the summits of the twin
peaks unmolested they could not scale the ship&rsquo;s
side; so, with plenty of provisions and an arsenal
to fight with, we felt fairly safe for the present.
In addition to the small arms, we had two brass
howitzers mounted at the bow and stern of the
<i>Seagull</i>. These were usually masked with canvas
sacks, designed to disguise them so the ordinary
observer would not notice our armament; but
they were now uncovered and put in order for
action, our men training them so as to command
the open space between us and the edge of the
dark forest.</p>
<p>We had ample time for these preparations. The
canoes guarding the reef passages lay motionless
and no sign of life was observable on the land
side. We hardly knew how to account for this;
whether they were tempting us to leave the ship
or were themselves preparing for an assault.
However, it was our business to &ldquo;stand pat&rdquo; and
await results.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>The day passed tediously. Lounging by the rail
we looked down upon the grim line of warriors,
so silent and motionless, and they looked up at us.
Fortunately for them they were beyond the range
of our rifles. I brought up my glasses and focused
them so the natives were distinctly visible in every
detail. They were handsome, stalwart fellows,
averaging fully six feet in height I judged, although
now all were crouching in the canoes.
They were not black, as were Nux and Bryonia,
but a dark chocolate brown. Their hair seemed
straight and fine of texture and was allowed to
grow long and be curled into a knot at the back
of the head, as women often wear it. Their only
article of dress was a loin cloth, made of a dark
colored material on which were sewn curious designs
in pearls. All wore ornaments of pearls,
such as necklaces, armlets and anklets, the gems
being of such size and color that I believe the
humblest native in the line carried the equivalent
of a fortune upon his person.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>I watched the Pearl People for hours. Their
marked characteristic seemed to be patience.
Their features seemed finely cut and intelligent,
but the members of the patrol were just now very
apathetic, seldom changing their positions or indulging
in the interchange of remarks. Their
business was simply to wait, and they displayed
marvelous resignation to duty. If they were curious
they did not show it; if they resented this
inactivity they gave the resentment no expression.
Automatons could not have been more docile. Yet
the Faytans struck me as being dignified, reserved
and most admirably trained to obedience, while
their stern countenances marked them as cold and
cruel.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, while a dismal silence pervaded
the ship, I was startled by hearing the clear
tones of our piano. Some one began to play a
spirited march, and of course I knew it was Lucia.
The brave girl was trying to cheer us all with her
music, and I am bound to admit it had an animating
effect. For an hour she played and sang,
choosing the most stirring tunes she knew, and
when I finally went below I found all the passengers
had gathered in the cabin with Joe and
Uncle Naboth, while young Alfonso was joining
in a Spanish madrigal that was popular in his own
country and all thoughts of our precarious position
seemed thrust into the background.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>That evening De Jiminez played &eacute;cart&eacute; with
his mother while Madam de Alcantara was led
to forget her fears far enough to read a book.
We lighted the cabin brilliantly, making no further
attempt to evade the watching eyes of the
natives, and enjoyed a few hours of solace if not
of pleasure.</p>
<p>Next day the waiting game was continued.
South Sea natives seldom or never attack at night,
according to Nux; but these Faytans were so
unlike other savage tribes that we could not be
sure this was one of their customs. So we divided
the watch and kept a sharp lookout night and day.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER IX</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">ALFONSO&rsquo;S ANTOINETTE</span></h2>
<p>Nothing happened this second day of our imprisonment.
The Faytans evidently had some
plan of campaign mapped out, or they would not
have established the patrol of canoes. We began
to consider what their intentions could be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s give &rsquo;em credit for a leetle intelligence,&rdquo;
said Uncle Naboth, who had been studying the
natives through his binoculars. &ldquo;The chief that
runs this place must have some ability, and as
soon as he discovered us here he must &rsquo;a&rsquo; thought
it all out. Mebbe he lay awake doin&rsquo; it, for next
mornin&rsquo; we found them canoes on guard. That
was the first trick in the game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bad one, either,&rdquo; I remarked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not from the chief&rsquo;s standpoint. It kept us
from escapin&rsquo; in the boats, which is the one thing,
it seems, he don&rsquo;t intend to let happen. Now, our
boys here,&rdquo; pointing to Bryonia and Nux, &ldquo;have
a notion that the Pearl People don&rsquo;t want any
strangers around. They never let &rsquo;em land, if
they can help it, and drive &rsquo;em away or kill &rsquo;em.
Accordin&rsquo; to that theory the Faytans ought to be
glad to have us go. But here they are, keepin&rsquo;
us fast prisoners. Why&rsquo;s that, Bry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bryonia had stood moodily silent. He now
looked up and shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t say, Mars Nabot&rsquo;,&rdquo; he answered. But
he spoke in a hesitating way that led me to think
he preferred not to speak frankly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really a puzzler,&rdquo; resumed Uncle Naboth.
&ldquo;If they mean to kill us, why don&rsquo;t they start in
and fight it out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps they realize our position is impregnable,&rdquo;
I suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t exactly that,&rdquo; declared my uncle. &ldquo;If
they happen to think to shoot some burnin&rsquo; arrers
at us, they can easily set fire to the ship, an&rsquo; then
we&rsquo;re done for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not knowin&rsquo; about ships, they may not think
of that,&rdquo; said my father, uneasily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what then?&rdquo; asked De Jiminez.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; replied Joe, &ldquo;the wily islanders expect
to conquer us in one of two ways. First to starve
us out, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They can&rsquo;t do that in a hurry,&rdquo; muttered the
Captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And second to let us die of thirst,&rdquo; continued
Joe.</p>
<p>We all became thoughtful at this suggestion.
I knew we had supplies of fresh water sufficient
for an ordinary voyage, and an a&euml;rator to doctor
it with if it became stagnant and unpalatable; but
barreled water is not the safest thing to depend
upon, and thirst was a greater menace than lack
of food. Yet it seemed improbable that a savage
chieftain would have thought this all out and determined
upon so tedious and unwarlike a plan
of conquest.</p>
<p>Afterward I found Bryonia alone and said to
him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you think the Faytans wish to keep
us here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo; know, Mars Sam.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes you do, Bry. Anyhow, you&rsquo;ve some
idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may be wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is in confidence, Bry. You may trust
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hesitated a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish, Mars Sam,&rdquo; he said in a low voice,
speaking his native tongue, &ldquo;that the lady passengers
had not showed themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; I exclaimed. &ldquo;Are the natives
partial to white women, Bry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know other chiefs,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I know
they like to take women of other nations for
wives. In my own island it is like that. I think
if we were only warriors the Faytans would drive
us away, or let us take the boats out. That is
the only way I can explain the strange manner in
which they are acting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may be right,&rdquo; I returned, and walked
away to think it over.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>The third day brought no more incident than
the others that preceded it. I had abandoned the
idea that the Faytans intended to besiege us until
we succumbed to hunger or thirst, and told Joe so.
Also I confided to my chum Bry&rsquo;s theory that
they were concocting a plan to get our women.
This made Joe look grave and anxious.</p>
<p>When Alfonso joined us, presently, I thought
it best to acquaint him with our fears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that is so,&rdquo; said the boy, &ldquo;we will see that
the women never fall into their hands alive. But
I am confident there will be some way of escape
open to us before our condition gets desperate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your father doing?&rdquo; I asked, thinking
I would like a conference with Se&ntilde;or de Jiminez.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is writing a speech to deliver before the
Colombian Congress when he becomes president,&rdquo;
replied Alfonso with a smile. &ldquo;Poor father! He
doesn&rsquo;t know what despair means. I&rsquo;m sure he
has no real conception of our present position.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; said Joe, musingly, as he stared out
over the island, &ldquo;that I could see into that forest
yonder. I wonder if it&rsquo;s full of watching natives,
or if they&rsquo;re all lying snug in the big Pearl City
we&rsquo;ve heard about.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>Alfonso was thoughtful. For awhile he, too,
stared at the forest. Then a sudden idea occurred
to him, for his face brightened and he laughed
aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fellows,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a notion to go over
to that city and see what it looks like. Also, I&rsquo;ll
take a peep into the forest as I pass by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked at him in amazement, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you gone crazy, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again he laughed, quite gleefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder you suspect my sanity,&rdquo; he answered;
&ldquo;but the truth is that I had forgotten all
about a certain important shipment of mine that
is now in the hold of this ship and may be of
great help to us in our present emergency. However,&rdquo;
he added, more soberly, &ldquo;the thing was
intended for a far different purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A shipment? What is it?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, nothing more nor less than one of those
new fashioned biplanes. I bought one of the latest
improved <i>Antoinettes</i> when I went over to
Paris, during the time father was purchasing the
arms in Australia. He sent me there on some
banking business, you know, and I naturally took
in the aviation exhibition. It did not take me long
to decide that a biplane would be of great assistance
to the revolution and I induced the great
Bleriot himself to teach me how to work it. Before
I left Paris I could manage the thing beautifully,
and I&rsquo;ve made a good many successful
flights. It is all packed in three cases, with bands
of red paint around them so they can be identified
from the arms, and I have many extra parts
in separate cases. It must seem queer to you to
realize I have a flying machine in this out-of-the-way
place&mdash;where we&rsquo;re shipwrecked on a savage
island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is strange,&rdquo; I admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>Antoinette</i> would make even you fellows
stare, I guess,&rdquo; continued Alfonso.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, as for that,&rdquo; said Joe, &ldquo;both Sam and I
have done some a&euml;rial stunts in our time, and
made some pretty long flights. But a biplane&rsquo;s
a new invention to us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>&ldquo;It occurred to me that I could put the machine
together here on deck,&rdquo; announced Alfonso, &ldquo;and
make a trip over the forest to the Pearl City. I
won&rsquo;t land there, of course, but I&rsquo;ll circle around
and find out what we want to know, and then
come back again. What do you think?&rdquo; he
asked a little anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems like a brilliant idea,&rdquo; I said approvingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you fellows help me to get it together?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Joe. &ldquo;And the sooner the
better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then order your men to fetch up the boxes
with the red bands. There are three of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I went to Uncle Naboth and my father and explained
what Little Jim wanted to do. They both
considered the thing impracticable and foolhardy,
but said we could give the young Colombian
whatever assistance he needed.</p>
<p>So the boxes were sent for and presently hoisted
from the hold by means of the cranes provided for
such purposes. Only one was at all heavy, and
that contained the motor and tools.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>The carpenter unscrewed the covers and soon
a confused mass of canvas planes, braces, platforms
and other odds and ends lay upon the deck.
Alfonso, with his coat off and sleeves rolled up,
began to select the pieces and connect them. He
had written instructions for setting up the machine,
but did not need to refer to them often, being
evidently quite familiar with the details of
its mechanism.</p>
<p>It did not seem to me that the thing was at all
serviceable; it was very frail and more like a toy
than a flying machine; but the boy assured me it
was an exact duplicate of the one that held the
world&rsquo;s record for altitude and speed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you afraid to trust yourself to it?&rdquo;
asked Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afraid! Of course not,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;It
is perfectly safe if operated intelligently&mdash;barring
unavoidable accidents.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>We both assisted, being guided by his directions,
and all three of us worked the remainder
of that day. Lucia discovered us at about the time
we began assembling the airship, and was so
fascinated by the proposition that she remained
constantly by our side, watching every move we
made. She made no remarks, but her dark eyes
missed no detail, and whenever Alfonso instructed
us she listened as carefully as we did. It seemed
queer for a girl to take such an interest in a flying
machine&mdash;a thing that some men do not care to
fool with. In addition to the girl a curious group
of the sailors surrounded us, for I have found
that those who sail the seas have a certain sympathy
for those who sail the air.</p>
<p>I had myself become enthusiastic over the machine,
as I began to understand the theory of its
operation. The <i>Antoinette</i> was as scientifically
constructed as it was delicate and graceful. I
could see possibilities in the thing, now, and that
night was a sleepless one for me, so eager was I
to continue our work the next morning. We got
the frame complete the second day, and set the
engines in position.</p>
<p>By evening the biplane seemed all ready to fly,
but Alfonso asserted it must be adjusted and
tested with the utmost care, as all depended on
the tenseness and equalization of the planes. He
told us, however, he hoped to make the flight the
following morning.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>Our relations with the natives had remained
unchanged. The only event of each day was the
arrival of food and supplies for the floating besiegers.
These were brought in canoes around
the island and a share distributed to each of the
line of boats. Then the commissary department
silently withdrew and the excitement was over.
As for the guard, their patience seemed untiring.
The warriors must have been more or less
cramped in their canoes. If some of them were
relieved at times, it was during the nights, for
darkness fell upon the silent line and daybreak
found it still unbroken. Perhaps some slept, lying
in the bottoms of the canoes, while others watched.
I have no means of knowing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>Finally our youthful and adventurous Colombian
got his machine adjusted to suit him, explaining
to Joe and me, as he worked, all the
details of equilibrium and shifting the balance,
and how to handle the wheel and run the motors.
The engines were not unlike those used on automobiles,
yet lighter in weight and made as delicately
as a watch. The wheel answered the
slightest touch, and any change in direction required
a quick eye and quick thought. Indeed, to
fly in a biplane is no dreamy man&rsquo;s job, for every
nerve and muscle must be tense and responsive
and lend life to the inanimate thing he directs.</p>
<p>Alfonso was cool as a cucumber while making
his tests and I could see that his eager enthusiasm
was due more to the delights of an exhilarating
flight through the air than a desire to see the
Pearl City, or discover what our enemies were
doing. Doubtless he had for some time been
aching for an opportunity to use his novel machine,
and his present attempt was mainly due
to this wish.</p>
<p>Being of a mechanical turn of mind and interested
in all such propositions, I followed intently
every movement that Alfonso made in putting the
biplane together, adjusting it and preparing for
the flight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I almost believe I could work it myself,&rdquo; I remarked
with a smile.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>&ldquo;That &lsquo;almost&rsquo; qualifies your egotism,&rdquo; replied
Little Jim, with assurance. &ldquo;It is the flight itself&mdash;the
management of the machine in the air&mdash;that
really requires knowledge and skill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that can only come with experience,&rdquo; I
said. &ldquo;How many flights have you made?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Several,&rdquo; he declared proudly. &ldquo;Once I remained
in the air for thirty-seven minutes. I
can do better than that, now, for I have here an
improved machine and the condition of the atmosphere
in these latitudes is almost perfect, since
the storm cleared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took his seat in the machine. We had
cleared a long run along the deck, from stern to
stem, for his use in starting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take a turn among those
boats over the reefs. I may land here on my
return, or I may keep on over the island; it will
depend upon circumstances.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>Every soul aboard had gathered to watch this
interesting attempt, and I noticed that Lucia&rsquo;s
eyes were big and sparkling with excitement.
Alfonso was quite the hero of the hour and it
filled him with pride and elation to be the observed
of all observers. His father, who had always
vigorously opposed his son&rsquo;s experiments
with airships, but realized the fact that the biplane
might be of much service to the revolution, was a
curious and silent spectator. He had indulged in
a stiff argument with Alfonso the night before, but
had met defeat at the hands of his wayward son.
The boy&rsquo;s courage and confidence were indisputable,
and perhaps Se&ntilde;or de Jiminez was a bit proud
of his son&rsquo;s progressive ideas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The airship is bound to be a great factor in
the future history of nations,&rdquo; asserted Alfonso,
and this could not be successfully controverted
until the future revealed itself and became history.</p>
<p>Joe and I followed directions in turning the
motor and running the machine along the deck
for a start. It rose just before it reached the
bow, soared over the rail and headed straight
out to sea, still ascending. Absolute silence pervaded
the anxious group on deck. We could
plainly hear the whir of the motors as the biplane,
swift as a dart, flew over the reefs, descried
a graceful curve and circled around the boats a
hundred feet or more in the air.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>The Faytans were certainly a stolid lot, as we
afterward proved; but the flight of the airship
was so startling that they craned their necks to
watch it, and some rose in the canoes while others
ducked down and covered their heads as if in
terror. Fear was unknown to this people, but
superstition bound them in chains, and this surely
seemed like a demonstration of the gods.</p>
<p>I must admit the boy handled the machine
beautifully, and it responded to his touch like a
thing of life. Several times he circled around,
then swept out to sea until he was a mere birdlike
speck, and finally came back and headed directly
for the ship. Perhaps it had been five or six
minutes since he left us, but to us it seemed an
hour, so excited were we by his daring and his
success.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>We kept the deck clear, pressing close to the
rail, and it seemed Alfonso&rsquo;s intention to land.
He came toward us in a straight line; then the
machine dipped, for as it neared us it was fully
three hundred feet above the sea. Now the
a&euml;ronaut shut down the motors and glided gracefully
downward at an angle of nearly forty degrees.
We were preparing to shout our applause,
when like a great bird the biplane swept over the
deck, struck the mainmast at about its middle and
came crashing down in a heap&mdash;operator and
a&euml;roplane being mixed in a confused jumble.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER X</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE PEARL CITY</span></h2>
<p>Joe and I rushed in first of all and pulled
Alfonso out of the wreck. He was insensible and
bleeding profusely from a cut across the forehead.
Others eagerly took the boy from us and
carried him below, his father sobbing that his son
was dead, dead, dead! and now could never become
the president of Colombia.</p>
<p>I knew well enough Alfonso wasn&rsquo;t dead, and
told Lucia so when she asked me with a white,
startled face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little damaged, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; said I, and
watched her as she hurried away, womanlike, to
render what assistance she could.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It were surely wonderful!&rdquo; cried Uncle Naboth,
viewing the mangled biplane that lay at the
foot of the mast; &ldquo;but he&rsquo;s spoilt his flying machine
the first trip.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not at all sure about that,&rdquo; I replied.
&ldquo;What do you think, Joe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s like Alfonso&mdash;a little damaged,
that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; he answered with a grin. &ldquo;The
motor seems all right, and that&rsquo;s the main thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We made an examination, then, and found
some of the framework of the planes splintered.
Otherwise nothing was injured and a little work
would soon restore the thing to good working
order.</p>
<p>Bryonia and &ldquo;Capstan Bob,&rdquo; the latter having
been a poor doctor before he became a good
sailor, attended the injured boy, and soon word
came up that Alfonso had regained consciousness.
He had broken his left arm and cut his scalp
open, but was not seriously injured. Late in the
afternoon he asked to see me, and when I went
down to his room I found him quite cheerful
over his personal mishap, but worried about the
condition of his biplane. This I assured him
could easily be repaired, and he told me there
was a supply of extra frames in one of the boxes,
and asked me to look after the airship and rig it
up again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>&ldquo;I want to make another trip in it as soon as I
am able,&rdquo; he told me. &ldquo;This broken arm is an
unfortunate thing, but I guess I can manage the
wheel with my right hand. Are you sure the
motor is uninjured?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It worked smoothly when I tested it,&rdquo; I answered;
&ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll go over it again more carefully
and make sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do,&rdquo; he urged. &ldquo;You and Joe can do the
work, and to-morrow I&rsquo;ll come on deck and direct
you. I&rsquo;ll be all right by that time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The morning, however, found Alfonso so stiff
and sore from his bruises, his gashed forehead
and his cracked arm, that he could not leave his
berth. The women waited upon him tirelessly
and Joe and I, left to our own devices, decided
to get to work on the biplane without the owner&rsquo;s
assistance. It interested us more than ever, now
that we had seen what the thing could do, and I
had acquired a powerful desire to test its virtues
myself. If we could restore the machine to good
condition, and should our safety demand knowledge
of the movements of the natives, I felt I
would not hesitate to undertake a flight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>All that day we worked, finding spare parts to
replace those that had been damaged. It was
evident that accidents to the frame were expected
and anticipated, since duplicates of almost every
part of them had been furnished. Only the motor
and steering gear were without duplicate parts;
but these were little likely to become injured, even
by a direct fall.</p>
<p>On the following morning Joe and I arose before
daybreak and got Bry to make us some coffee
while we finally adjusted the biplane. I had decided
to attempt a flight secretly, as I feared
Se&ntilde;or de Jiminez or his son would refuse us permission
had we asked to go. The seat was so
arranged that it would carry two; so, both Joe
and I being light in weight ought not to prove too
great a burden for the machine. I had intended
to go alone, at first, but Joe begged so hard that
I did not like to refuse him, and he agreed to
allow me to manage it without interference.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>We instructed Bry and Ned Britton how to
start us, but we took our run on the deck from
stem to stern, so as to head over the island.</p>
<p>The <i>Antoinette</i> rose like a bird&mdash;just as the
sun came up&mdash;and with a sense of elation and
delight I realized we were actually flying. Up
we shot, right over the forest, which came beneath
us so suddenly that for the first time I recognized
the marvelous speed of the machine.</p>
<p>Determined to investigate this threatening barrier,
I turned the wheel so as to descry a succession
of circles and descended until we were
just above the tallest tree tops. Joe had a pair of
powerful glasses, and while I watched the biplane
he examined the forest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The woods are full of savages,&rdquo; he remarked,
attentively looking downward; &ldquo;but most of them
are lined up facing the ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are they doing?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stripping the trees of bark, and flattening it
out. That&rsquo;s queer. All are working at this
except the double line of sentries at the edge of
the forest.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps they&rsquo;re making shields of the bark,&rdquo;
I suggested; &ldquo;in which case they intend to attack
us presently. But if they think we use bows and
arrows, which a bark shield will stop, they&rsquo;re
much mistaken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows what they think?&rdquo; muttered my
companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who cares? Keep your balance, Joe;
I&rsquo;m going to explore the rest of the island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>First I rose to quite an altitude, so that we
might determine the extent of the island. Then
I spied a large settlement at the far east of us&mdash;the
farthest point from the ship&mdash;and deciding
that this was the Pearl City I headed directly
for it.</p>
<p>A few moments only sufficed to bring us above
the city, a journey of perhaps ten miles from
our starting point. Here again I circled while
we inspected the place.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>The city was of tremendous extent; for here,
we afterward learned, resided every inhabitant of
Faytan. There was a pretty landlocked bay before
it, and the water front was thick with craft,
mostly with canoes such as we had seen, although
there were some ponderous flat-bottomed boats
that resembled rafts more than ships. These I
thought might be used for the pearl fishing, although
they were gaudily decorated and had many
seats with rudely carved backs.</p>
<p>Between the forest and the city were large
cultivated fields, with groups of cocoanut and
date palms showing here and there, and we discovered
several bands of workers on these farms,
all calmly engaged in performing their proper
tasks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>But the city itself was far more interesting
than its surroundings. The buildings were of
clay bricks, of a light gray color, little wood
being used in their construction. They were of
great size and laid out in regular order, forming
streets that radiated in all directions from a central
square. Directly in the middle of this space
was a great circular building which was painted
a dark blue color&mdash;the only painted building in
the city&mdash;and lavishly decorated with pearls.
The doorways, windows and cornices, and even
portions of the dome, were thickly set with these
precious gems, only pearls of great size and luster
being chosen for the purpose. This was the temple;
but I ought to explain that many of these details
were not perceived by us at that time, while we
circled in the biplane over the city and looked
curiously down upon it. Perhaps it was this very
curiosity that was our undoing, for I must have
neglected the machine in some way to send it
suddenly swerving, first to one side and then the
other, in an erratic motion that was bewildering
and instantly destroyed my cool confidence. The
strain on the planes was dangerous, and although
we managed to keep our balance I could not
steady the thing nor bring it to a stable equilibrium.
We were at a dangerous elevation should
we fall, and to avoid this catastrophe I involuntarily
descended, without any regard as to where
we might land.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>It was almost a fall, as it was. We first dove
headlong, at a dangerous angle, and then I
swung her head up, shut off the motor, and she
fluttered, rocked and came to a sudden stop with
a jolt that well nigh drove the breath from our
bodies. Joe pitched from the seat and rolled
over a few times; then he sat up and looked at
me in a dazed way that would have made me
laugh had I not been wondering just then how
many bones I had broken. But after the jar on
my nerves had subsided I crawled out of the machine,
which dropped its planes as if ashamed of
its rude action, and found we were on the flat
top of one of the high buildings that overlooked
the place of the Pearl Temple.</p>
<p>I crawled to the edge, which had a low parapet,
and looked over. A hundred eyes met mine,
staring at me with wonder in spite of the stoic
nature of these remarkable islanders.</p>
<p>It was not strange that they marveled. Airships
are not yet everyday affairs in our own
country, so this one might well startle the natives
of a secluded South Sea island which even
ships do not sight. I am not certain which party
was at first most bewildered, Joe and I or the
Faytans; but we were first to recover, and our
desperate situation called for decisive thought.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>Hastily I ran over the machine. A guide rope
had parted, and I promptly knotted it together
again. In all other respects the <i>Antoinette</i>
seemed uninjured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get aboard, Joe!&rdquo; I cried; &ldquo;we must make a
run for it the best way we can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone has to push the thing,&rdquo; he returned.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll start it and you take it away, Sam. If you
reach the ship safely you can come back with a
rescue party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nonsense!&rdquo; I exclaimed. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t go
without you, and you know it. Here, help me
run it over to the edge, and we&rsquo;ll see what we
can do. It may dip at first, but there is lots of
room in the square down there for us to get a
start and rise again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And lots of savages to grab us if we bump
the ground. My way&rsquo;s best, Sam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your way is impossible!&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;We will
either go together, or we&rsquo;ll both stay right here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>The speech was prophetic. Before I had the
words well out of my mouth the natives began to
pour in a stream out upon the roof, coming
through a square hole in the center which we
had not thought to guard.</p>
<p>Each of us was armed with a brace of revolvers,
but we hesitated to use them. As we backed
away to the furthermost edge I said to Joe:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t shoot. They&rsquo;ll capture us anyhow
by force of numbers, and we&rsquo;ll stand better with
them if we don&rsquo;t hurt anyone. Keep your pistols
out of sight, for a better time may come to
use them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; he said briefly.</p>
<p>The Faytans lined up before us, a score of
great muscular fellows with singularly intelligent
features and of grave, dignified demeanor.
As I looked upon them I decided to adopt a certain
plan of action. Extending my hand and
smiling in a fearless, friendly manner, I slowly
advanced toward the man directly in front of
me. There seemed to be no captain or leader
among them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>&ldquo;Greeting, good friends,&rdquo; I said in the language
of Tuamotu, the island Nux and Bry had
come from, and which they had long ago taught
me to speak. All the natives of the South Seas
have, I believe, a common language, although
each island seems to use a dialect or &ldquo;brogue&rdquo;
of its own. At any rate the islanders seem able
to understand one another when they meet in
peace or war, and for that reason I hoped to
make myself understood.</p>
<p>That I succeeded was soon apparent. The
man did not take my extended hand, but he said
in a deep, musical voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are not friends. It is not possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo; I returned, as if astonished. And, indeed,
his frankness was surprising, for these
islanders are usually subtle and deceptive, claiming
friendship when they intend murder. &ldquo;Why
is it not possible for us to be friends?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because you come unasked. Because we do
not harbor strangers. Because intruders deserve
death, and the laws of the Faytans decree it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was not at all pleasant.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>&ldquo;We came not here of our own will,&rdquo; I said
after a moment&rsquo;s hesitation. &ldquo;The gods of the
Storm and Wind thrust us upon your island.
We wish to go away; to return to our own
country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That cannot be,&rdquo; said another standing near
the first speaker. &ldquo;To allow a stranger from the
world beyond the sea to escape would be to allow
him to carry tales of Faytan to his countrymen.
Then they would send many boats here
to rob us of our pearls and make us trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Therefore,&rdquo; added another, &ldquo;you must die
to save Faytan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In what way?&rdquo; I asked, more to gain time
than because the mode of dying interested me
just then.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The King will determine that. We will take
you to the King.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; I responded cheerfully. &ldquo;Come,
Joe; let&rsquo;s visit the King.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>He grinned at this, for Joe isn&rsquo;t easily scared,
and we allowed the Faytans to escort us from
the roof, going so docilely that they did not bind
us or even touch our bodies. They merely surrounded
us in a dense mass, and since they were
of gigantic size and strong as bulls that was as
secure a method as any.</p>
<p>The house through which we passed was not
badly arranged or furnished. We saw numerous
rooms from the corridors we traversed, and
they were more pleasant and homelike than you
might suppose, considering this to be an uncivilized
island which the world&rsquo;s progress had never
yet thought of.</p>
<p>The square outside&mdash;it was a circle, really&mdash;was
thronged with men, women and children, all
scantily clad as far as clothing was concerned,
but the humblest wearing a fortune in pearl
ornaments.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>This island of Faytan must be very populous.
There were at least two hundred men in the boats
guarding the reefs; the forest was full of them;
many were working in the fields, and still the
Pearl City was packed full, as far as we could
see. The natives were of superior physique and
intelligence. We had thought Nux and Bry exceptionally
well built fellows, for South Sea
Islanders, and we had often proved their fidelity
and keenness of intellect; but the Faytans were
fully their equals in every respect, and I knew
from the reports of Tuamotu that they had no
such capital as the Pearl City and lived in a more
primitive manner.</p>
<p>Crossing the square between close ranks of
silent, staring natives, we were escorted to the
steps of the Great Temple and in through a high
arched doorway.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">A KING, A PRIEST AND A BOY</span></h2>
<p>To our surprise there was no great hall of concourse
before us, but an entrance hall from which
opened several doorways hung with finely woven
mats, all of which were lavishly decorated with
conventional designs in pearls. Before each
doorway stood a guard, armed with a spear and
a double-edged battle-ax, the latter fashioned
from gypsum by the method employed by the
North American Indians.</p>
<p>There was a captain of these guards and when
one of our conductors spoke to him in a low voice
this official disappeared through a central doorway.
He returned presently and Joe and I were
told to follow him. After us came merely a half
dozen of our captors, closing the rear, and so in
stately procession we tramped down a long corridor
and came to the throne room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>It was a high, spacious apartment, having
many windows covered with translucent fish-skin
dyed in various colors. These had the appearance
of stained glass and were quite effective.
Around three sides of the room ran a stone bench
covered with mattings and in the center was a
raised place, or dais, with a broad, pearl-encrusted
seat.</p>
<p>Heaped upon the royal bench were many gay
colored blankets woven from a soft cocoanut
fibre, and lying flat upon these, face downward, was
the mighty King of Faytan.</p>
<p>His Majesty was only a boy. His copper-colored
form was lean and slender, but no greater
in length than my own.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p>He did not move for a time and I had opportunity
to examine him curiously. The knot of
hair twisted upon the back of his head was decorated
with five monstrous black pearls&mdash;the
rarest and most valuable sort known. Around
his waist was a broad belt on which exquisite
rose pearls were thickly clustered. Over his
shoulder was draped a short cloak sewn thick
with the same precious gems. But aside from
this richness of decoration there was nothing to
distinguish the youthful king from his subjects,
unless it was his attitude. This might indicate
grief, despair or suffering, for though he
moved not a muscle there was such utter abandon
in his pose that I caught myself feeling sorry for
the youth&rsquo;s misery without knowing why or how
he was miserable.</p>
<p>We stood motionless, awaiting his royal pleasure.
After a time, with a slow, writhing motion
he raised himself to a sitting position and showed
his face to us.</p>
<p>I was born and bred in a democratic republic,
and believe that all men are free and equal; nevertheless
there was a serene dignity in this boy&rsquo;s
countenance that plainly marked him royal.
Wherever I might have met him I should have
recognized in him the king; yet he was a mere
savage secluded on an unknown island.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>The unhappiness that had marked his former
attitude showed plainly in his face, but its proud
regard seemed to demand no pity from anyone.
Whatever it was, the king was strong enough to
bear it alone.</p>
<p>He eyed Joe and me with calm interest, his
look flashing over us from head to heel and noting
every detail of our appearance. Then he
turned to the captain of the guard and nodded
permission for him to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Flying through the air on a thing with
wings,&rdquo; began the man, &ldquo;these two intruders
alighted upon the top of the house of Aza, where
they were captured. They are brought before
your Majesty for judgment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The king passed his hand across his eyes with
a wearied gesture. Then he looked toward us
again and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are young.&rdquo; His voice was low and
soft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are also young, your Majesty,&rdquo; I ventured
to state.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you understand our tongue?&rdquo; he said
quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Imperfectly. I was taught to speak it by a
native of Tuamotu.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tuamotu! So you have come here to get our
pearls?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed. We were shipwrecked, having
been driven out of our course by the storm. We
are not robbers, your Majesty, but only unfortunate
voyagers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are indeed unfortunate to land upon the
shore of Faytan,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;It means death to all
of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not necessarily,&rdquo; I returned, coolly. &ldquo;For my
part, I expect to live a long time yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not understand,&rdquo; he persisted gently.
&ldquo;It is the law of the island&mdash;the law of my forefathers&mdash;that
all strangers who land upon Faytan
shall be put to death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A cruel law,&rdquo; I remarked; &ldquo;and an unjust
one.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is to protect us from invasion,&rdquo; he explained
in a kindly tone. &ldquo;This is the richest island in all
the world, and the most favored by nature. My
people are the bravest and strongest of mankind.
No other nation can at all compare with this, for
we are protected and favored by the powerful
Pearl God.&rdquo; As he mentioned this deity all the
Faytans present prostrated themselves, muttering:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The King is the Priest of the Pearl God.
Through him we acquire power and protection!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The king had also bowed his head, reverently
and with no hint of self-adulation. When the
chant ended he turned to us and continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strangers, it is not through hatred that your
death is decreed. There is no hate in my breast,
although you have killed my father, the late King
of Faytan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His voice faltered, and I exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Killed the King! We? It is impossible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His grief was readily explained now, but although
these people posed as our enemies I was
really shocked at the assertion that we had rendered
this boy fatherless.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>&ldquo;I do not think the deed was intentional,&rdquo; he returned,
musingly, &ldquo;for it was dark and your
weapons could single out no man. But my noble
father&rsquo;s death was the result of your coming here.
When runners from the other end of the island
brought the news of your arrival, my father the
King set out at once with a band of chosen warriors
to capture you. He arrived at the cove at
nightfall, in time to see your people leap into your
boats and start out to sea. Our warriors sent arrows
after you, and you replied with the weapons
that sting. One stung my father and he fell dead.
The warriors brought him back to the Pearl City,
where I slept, and I was awakened to be told I
had lost my dearest friend and was now the King
of Faytan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He bowed his head again and for a time remained
motionless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; I said quietly. &ldquo;It was the fortune
of war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he returned, raising his head to look at
me curiously; &ldquo;the fortune of war; the same fate
that led you here in the storm to meet your death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I began to feel a little uneasy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there no way of evading that foolish law of
yours?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>&ldquo;No. Away from Faytan every stranger is
safe. He is nothing to us then. But when a
stranger comes to Faytan the law decrees his
death. There is no escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does the law say in what manner we are to
die?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. The King determines that. But it is our
custom to grant our prisoners the easiest death of
which we have knowledge, which is by drowning.
The only demand of the law is that every invader
shall die. There is no desire on our part to be
cruel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I pondered the matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does the law state how soon the prisoner shall
die?&rdquo; was my next inquiry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. That would, of course, depend upon circumstances,&rdquo;
he admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case, there is no need for us to worry
over my death for the present, or over that of this
friend who is with me,&rdquo; said I in my easiest manner.
&ldquo;I begin to admire your law, your Majesty.
It says very truly that every intruder upon your
island shall die. But every native of Faytan, too,
must die&mdash;in time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He saw my point, but was not impressed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>&ldquo;The law says you shall be put to death, not
that you will be permitted to die in time,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh; very well, let it be that way,&rdquo; I agreed.
&ldquo;But I am innocent of any intent to wrong you, or
any of your people, your Majesty; so I appeal to
you to postpone putting me to death as long as
possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stared at me in a puzzled way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not fear,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;that drives you
to beg for your life&mdash;for a few brief hours or
days. What is it, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve acquired a habit of living,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and
I hate to break it. Also I have a duty to perform&mdash;to
instruct you in the truth concerning the great
world outside of Faytan, of which I find you are
very ignorant. I must show you how far behind
other nations you are; how much you have yet to
learn. You cannot gain this information from
your own people, who are as ignorant as you are;
you must gain it from me, before I am put to
death. You say proudly that you rule a great
country, but there is a way for you to make it a
far greater country. You say your people are
happy and prosperous, but I can teach you how to
give them many comforts they are now without.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>At last I had interested him, for he was an intelligent
youth. His eyes flashed. He rose to
his feet, facing me, and asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you do this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; and more. I can tell you of things you
have never even dreamed of, which will make
Faytan greater and more powerful than it has ever
been&mdash;since the beginning of time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;your death shall wait until I
have listened to your teachings. But do not misunderstand
me. I grant you neither pardon nor
life. I merely postpone your death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is fair enough,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;I am
satisfied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Deliberately and with dignity he again seated
himself, turning toward my captors, who had
heard all this conversation plainly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may go,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>Evidently the king had no thought of asking
anyone&rsquo;s advice as to his actions. He told the
captain of the guard to take us to a certain room
and keep us safely until he sent for us, and as we
bowed low and left the youthful monarch he
turned and cast himself prone upon the blankets
of the throne again. When I looked back over my
shoulder I found he had buried his face in his
hands and his attitude was one of great dejection.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE &ldquo;CROOKED ONE&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>The Pearl Temple was also the Royal Palace,
for as the king was the sole priest of the Pearl
God it was fitting that his abode should be in this
sacred place. Seldom has a nation placed the
supreme power, both religious and political, in the
hands of one person. It is concrete autocracy and
usually a priesthood protects a country from its
king while the king protects it from the priests.
But here was decidedly a one-man rule&mdash;and the
man was a boy. If we could win the boy&rsquo;s friendship
there were no complications to thwart his will,
and therein lay our sole chance of salvation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<p>Joe and I talked it over in our prison, a fine big
room in the rear portion of the temple, with windows
opening on the square. There were no
guards, nor were we bound or otherwise restrained
except by the command of the king to remain in
the room until sent for. We might easily have
dropped from one of the windows to the crowded
streets; but that would have availed us nothing.
We might have walked out by way of the corridors,
and met the guards at the other end. Really,
we were safe enough, and our captors knew it.</p>
<p>Our unfortunate mishap caused us considerable
uneasiness. It was not so much on account of our
personal safety, although of that we had ample
cause to fear; but I worried lest my father or
Uncle Naboth, suspecting we were captured,
should send out a party to attempt to rescue us.
From my present information I knew that would
mean death to them all; only while in the ship
fort, with ample supplies of guns and ammunition,
could they successfully oppose these numerous and
powerful Faytans.</p>
<p>At noon we were given ample rations of excellent
food; fish, turtle and lobster forming the
chief dishes. The drinking water, almost ice-cold
from earthen jars, was the finest I ever tasted.
Women waited upon us, but when I spoke to them
in their native tongue they refused to answer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<p>After the meal the king came in, unannounced
and alone. The youth walked with great dignity
and his face was very sad. Sitting upon a bench
beside us he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will tell me of the world beyond the sea,
and I will listen. But first tell me your names, and
what island you come from.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We introduced ourselves and said we were
Americans, but of course that meant nothing to
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Attero, the twentieth of that name who
has ruled in Faytan,&rdquo; said he proudly. Then he
began to examine our clothing and to feel the
texture of the cloth, asking us how it was made
and of what use the various garments might be.</p>
<p>Joe is not much of a talker, so I spent several
hours giving the king the most primitive sort of
information, taking care to so explain our machinery
and inventions as to set him wondering at
our cleverness. He was more interested at first
in &ldquo;the weapon that stings&rdquo; than in any other
mechanical contrivance, and you may be sure I explained
the death-dealing character of our guns in
a most impressive manner.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<p>&ldquo;Your people are many, oh King,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;but
our rifles and revolvers have more stings in them
than you have people, although our own numbers
are so few.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pondered this a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought that might be so,&rdquo; he returned.
&ldquo;That is a reason why I did not sooner send my
people to capture you. My chief Medicine Man,
Kuru, has been studying this matter, and Kuru has
found that while the metal stings enter human
flesh, and pass through it, they do not go far into
the bark of the trees. For when my father and
some of his people were stung, many other stings
flew over their heads and reached the forest,
where we found the marks they made. This is
the first time such weapons have been used by
invaders into Faytan. All others have had spears
and arrows like our own. Also you are the only
pale-skins who have come to Faytan.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<p>&ldquo;The pale-skins have more wisdom than the
dark-skins,&rdquo; I asserted. &ldquo;They have conquered all
the known world. The reason Faytan has not yet
been conquered by us is that until the storm drove
us upon your coast we did not know such an island
existed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He bowed gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That proves how wise my forefathers were in
making our laws,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;We have been left
in peace because the restless pale-skins, who love
to conquer what does not belong to them, did not
know where to find Faytan. Had we permitted
any to leave our shores alive you would then have
heard of us. Also my forefathers declared that
other nations would want our pearls, which have
brought good luck to us for many years. Is that
also true?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; I replied frankly. &ldquo;My people like all
pretty things, and you must know that pearls are
found not alone in Faytan, but in many other parts
of the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He seemed surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As many as we have?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not. But pearls are not unknown to
us. See,&rdquo; and I showed him my watch fob, which
was set with a large diamond surrounded by small
pearls. He paid no attention to the diamond but
examined the pearls carefully. Then he smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you seen any so small, so dull and
colorless in my kingdom?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, your Majesty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such trifles grow in small shellfish, which we
do not open, but throw back into the sea to allow
them to grow. Those which you have are dead.
The life is gone from them. We know how to
keep all our pearls alive by bathing them in the
salt water,&rdquo; he said. Then he asked. &ldquo;What is
on the other end of this yellow chain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I exhibited my watch and explained its use. He
was greatly excited over this trinket, especially
when I showed him the wheels and how to keep
them going by winding. I thought it good policy
to make him a present of the watch, which was a
cheap affair, and he accepted it with evidences of
joy and gave me in return a necklace of pearls
worth a fortune.</p>
<p>When he left us he said:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<p>&ldquo;You must tell me more of your wonderful land
and your wise people, for truly you are able to
teach me much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused on his way out and came slowly
back to us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me how my people can be safe from your
stings,&rdquo; he begged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By keeping a long distance away from them,&rdquo;
I replied promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there no other way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None, your Majesty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My chief Medicine Man, Kuru, thought that
if we made shields of bark, and carried them before
us, the stings would not hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That explained the work we had seen the natives
doing in the forest. But I hastened to assure
King Attero that such shields were useless, as
when they came neat to our guns the bullets would
go through them easily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said he, in a grieved tone, &ldquo;many of
my people will die, for they will make the attack
to-morrow morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you not send swift messengers and stop
them?&rdquo; I asked anxiously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">180</div>
<p>&ldquo;I will not do that,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;for it is not
good to give one order to change another. But I
will spend the night in beseeching the great Pearl
God to protect my people from the pale-skins. Our
god has never yet failed us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that he left us and we saw no more of him
until the following afternoon. When he entered
our room then, the boy king was more cheerful of
countenance and stepped more firmly and proudly
than ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Pearl God told me not to fear, for all
would be well with my people,&rdquo; he announced.</p>
<p>I looked at him curiously. Could one so
naturally intelligent really believe some mythical
god had spoken to him? But it is not safe to
question anyone&rsquo;s religion. Ignoring the point I
asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you heard news of the battle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Many of my warriors have been killed,
and your ship has not yet been captured. But
they are still fighting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I heard this report with pleasure, and Joe
shouted: &ldquo;Hooray!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<p>The king did not seem annoyed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we do not succeed to-day, we will to-morrow,&rdquo;
he prophesied, with cool assurance. &ldquo;For
to-morrow I shall go to the battle myself, and
carry with me our greatest Chieftain, known as
the Crooked One.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May we go, also?&rdquo; I inquired, eagerly.</p>
<p>He considered the request thoughtfully. Then
he replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would seem best to drown you both this
evening, before I leave for the fight. The
Crooked One has advised that, and his wisdom is
great. But I wish to be taught more of your
knowledge, so I will let you live until my return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why must we stay here?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you assist me in defeating your people,
if I took you with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>He took my hand and touched it lightly to his
breast.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<p>&ldquo;What I like in the pale-skins,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is the
truth-tongue. You do not try to deceive me. That
is why I have let you live to teach me. From a
lying teacher I would gain but little knowledge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have said before that this boy was remarkably
intelligent for a savage. There was also a nobility
in his nature that was admirable and noteworthy.
I am no more truthful than the average American,
but it was not easy to try to deceive one of so
simple and frank a character. From the first I
had thought it the best policy to be honest with
him. Had the pale-skins always been honest in
their dealings with the dark-skinned races many
national tragedies would have been averted.</p>
<p>We passed several hours in conversation, Joe
taking a part in the talk, now and then, but leaving
most of it to me. Finally the king withdrew, saying
he would not see us again until after his return
from the &ldquo;war.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<p>It was getting dark and we were thinking of
going to bed on our benches&mdash;which were plentifully
supplied with soft blankets&mdash;when a sound
of slow and dragging footsteps along the corridor
aroused us. A light flickered across the doorway
and was followed by a native bearing a torch of
rottenwood.</p>
<p>At once I knew who it was. The shrewd,
withered features, iron-gray locks and penetrating
glance; the humpbacked frame, long arms and
spindle legs could belong to none but the &ldquo;Crooked
One,&rdquo; of whom the king had spoken. I wondered
if he came with his Majesty&rsquo;s permission,
for he shielded the torch with a portion of an
ample robe that partially covered his misshapen
body and peered at us silently a while before addressing
us.</p>
<p>Then he said, speaking in a low, soft voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strangers, I am here to assist you. Our
mighty King, the wise Attero, has accepted you
as his friends; but that will not save you from the
death which the law decrees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused impressively, and I asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What <i>will</i> save us, then?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps nothing at all,&rdquo; he returned, evasively.
&ldquo;But I am the King&rsquo;s adviser, even as I was his
father&rsquo;s adviser, and I command all the warriors
of Faytan. If King Attero listens to anyone, he
will listen to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you will try to save us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you will do what I am about to ask.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I reflected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There seems no way to evade the law,&rdquo; said I.
&ldquo;The law is as old as Faytan, I am told, and demands
the death of every stranger landing upon
your shores. The King has himself informed us
that he is powerless to evade the law, even if he
desired to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Crooked One smiled sardonically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who makes the laws of Faytan?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The King&rsquo;s forefathers made this law, it
seems,&rdquo; I returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;True. Only the King can make a law in Faytan.
And&mdash;<i>only the King can unmake it</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I sprang to my feet, inspired by a new hope.
Of course the king had power to abrogate the
present law! Why had I not thought of this before?
It was an absurd law. The king was our
friend.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<p>The Crooked One, having spoken so impressively,
was now regarding us with marked attention.
The look enabled me to recover my composure
quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>He sat down upon a bench, looking more
crooked than ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Chief of the Warriors of Faytan,&rdquo; he
repeated. &ldquo;I have fought many invaders, and all
are dead. For it is true that until now none has
been able to resist the number and power of the
Faytans I have led. Your own people cannot resist
them for long; yet they are more terrible in a
fight than any we have ever met. There are perhaps
as many persons in your ship as I have
fingers and toes; there are more Faytans than the
hairs of my head. In time, in spite of your stinging
weapons, which the King says are called guns,
we shall surely capture you all. But if there is
much fighting many of my warriors will have
died before we conquer and destroy the pale-skins.
I do not wish to have my warriors die.
Why is it necessary? So I have come to you, the
King&rsquo;s teachers, to say this: Teach me, also.
Teach me how to capture your people, and in return
I will ask the King to make a new law and
cancel the old one, so that you two will be permitted
to remain in Faytan as long as you live,
not only safe from harm but honored by the
King and all his people.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>
<p>&ldquo;Chief,&rdquo; I returned, amused but angry, &ldquo;we
could not be honored by anyone if we proved ourselves
dishonorable. Will any of your warriors
betray you, or your King, to save their own lives?
I do not think they would. Nor will we be less
noble than the Faytans. But I will give you this
answer: We could not betray our people if we
would; for there is no way you or your warriors
can avoid death if you fight with the pale-skins.
Had you made them your friends they would have
gone away and left you in peace. But if you
foolishly continue to make war upon them, you
and your island are lost forever, for no human
power can save you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<p>&ldquo;A man is but a man,&rdquo; he returned, &ldquo;whether
his skin be pale or brown. You have powerful
weapons, but you are few in numbers. If you
could kill half my warriors the other half would
finally conquer you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That remains to be proven,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>He arose from the bench and paced up and
down, the light of the torch making him appear
like some huge goblin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you would sacrifice your own lives to save
your friends?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Willingly, if it is necessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And are they as loyal to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any one of them would die to save us,&rdquo; I
asserted proudly.</p>
<p>He laughed at this; a low, cackling laugh that
was not pleasant to hear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then they must be allowed to do so,&rdquo; he said,
and picking up the torch left the room without
another word or even a parting glance in our
direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like that,&rdquo; growled Joe. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s up to
some deviltry, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">188</div>
<p>&ldquo;The same thing has occurred to me,&rdquo; I replied.
&ldquo;Let us remember his words. He will
allow our friends to die to save our lives. It&rsquo;s a
trick of some sort, Joe. The Crooked One is far
more dangerous than the King himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can he do?&rdquo; inquired my friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; but that clever old head has
conceived some shrewd idea, or I&rsquo;m greatly mistaken.
We must be on our guard, Joe. I wish
we had some way of warning our people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might send them a wireless,&rdquo; said Joe,
grinning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s go to bed and forget it,&rdquo; I suggested.
&ldquo;Nothing can happen before morning,
anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">LIVING SHIELDS</span></h2>
<p>But in this declaration I was wrong. Something
happened within the hour&mdash;a summons to
attend the king. We had gone to bed but had not
fallen asleep when the messenger came, so in a
few moments we were ready to follow the captain
of the guard to the throne room.</p>
<p>His Majesty was ready for the field. He bore
a short spear with rows of pearls set in the shaft,
and over his shoulder was slung a bow and sheaf
of arrows. In his belt was the native two-edged
tomahawk, and the young fellow looked fit to render
a good account of himself, had he been going
to fight savages like himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">190</div>
<p>Beside the king stood the Crooked One, who
bore no arms at all. We afterward learned that
this famous chieftain, contrary to the custom of
these islanders, never fought in person but contented
himself planning the battle and directing
his men. In this he was unconsciously imitating
the great generals of the civilized world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said Attero. &ldquo;We are ready for the
journey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! are we to go along?&rdquo; I asked in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he, and marched out into the
square. We followed. It was pitch dark, but a
group of men outside bore torches. Several litters
had been provided, similar to the &ldquo;stretchers&rdquo;
we carry wounded men on. The king took possession
of one of these, the Crooked One of another.
A third and fourth were for the use of Joe and
myself. As soon as I had reclined upon the litter
four men started away with it, going on a jog trot,
and I found it by no means uncomfortable.</p>
<p>It was a queer procession. Half a dozen runners
carried torches ahead of us to light the way.
The king&rsquo;s litter came first; then the chieftain&rsquo;s,
followed by mine and Joe&rsquo;s. More torchbearers
closed the line. And so we proceeded at a rapid
pace over hill and dale through the black night to
the opposite end of the island.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">191</div>
<p>As we came to the further edge of the forest,
dawn broke. It was a gray, dismal day and I
thought the sky threatened rain.</p>
<p>A great assemblage of warriors met us and
welcomed the king and the Crooked One with evident
satisfaction. I stood by and listened while
several leaders made their reports. It seemed the
fighting had been constant the day before, and
time and again the natives had been repulsed with
heavy loss. The &ldquo;stinging things&rdquo; went straight
through the bark shields, which the wise Kuru had
recommended, and they had therefore been abandoned.
Between the forest and the ship the plain
was strewn with dead and wounded Faytans, and
their friends could only go under cover of darkness
to reclaim their bodies, as whenever they
showed themselves a hail of bullets greeted them.</p>
<p>I was very proud to learn that my friends were
doing such excellent work. Against their rapid-fire
guns the poor natives with their primitive
weapons had no show whatever. Yet the simple
creatures had persisted in sacrificing themselves
uselessly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">192</div>
<p>The Crooked One listened calmly to the reports.
Then he asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have any of the invaders left the ship?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not any, they told him, since the two who were
prisoners had flown away through the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;To-day, my warriors,
we will capture all the pale-skins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was curious to learn how he would do it; but
breakfast seemed the first thing on the programme,
and of this meal Joe and I were given an ample
share.</p>
<p>Afterwards the king walked aside with his chieftain
while they conferred together privately,
speaking in low tones. The natives, stolid and
calm, obeying implicitly&mdash;and indifferent to life
or death&mdash;awaited their pleasure in silence. Then
Joe and I were led to the edge of the forest and
permitted to step out into the open and observe
the ship. There was no sign of life on board at
first, and rather anxiously I pulled out my handkerchief
and waved it to and fro, regardless of the
Faytans just behind me. Joe imitated my example
and after a moment a flag was run up on the
mainmast and ducked once or twice to show we
had been recognized.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">193</div>
<p>To find only that short distance separating us
from our friends was distinctly aggravating and
I was almost tempted to cut and run for the ship
and chance a spear thrust between my shoulders.
Turning my head to see how near the natives
were I found the Crooked One grinning with
much satisfaction, and saw him exchange a triumphant
glance with the youthful king.</p>
<p>This nettled me, for I at once suspected we had
been playing into the hands of our enemies and
for some reason had been placed where we were
in order that our friends on the ship might recognize
us. A moment later the chieftain gave a
signal and we were seized by strong natives and
our hands bound firmly behind our backs.</p>
<p>Then the mystery was explained.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">194</div>
<p>The Faytan warriors, fully armed, formed in
two long lines just behind us, Joe being placed in
front of one line and I before another. It was
easy to guess their plan then. They intended to
use us for living shields, believing our friends
would not dare to fire upon us, and so advance
near enough to the ship to board it with a rush
and slay the pale-skins by sheer force of numbers.</p>
<p>It was a desperate attempt, cleverly conceived,
and based upon my assertion to the Crooked One
that our friends would sacrifice themselves for
our sakes.</p>
<p>But nature took a hand in the game just then.
The sky had been overcast since daybreak, and
just as the two lines were advancing into the open,
pushing Joe and me before them, the clouds opened
and immense drops of rain came pattering down.
It grew dark, too, so that we could scarcely see
the ship, and the Faytans hesitated and looked
inquiringly at their chieftain.</p>
<p>The Crooked One eyed the sky, listened to the
low growl of thunder, and ordered his men back to
the forest. Next moment the rain came down in
floods, and a bolt of lightning crashed overhead
and sent a tall tree toppling down upon us. No
one was hurt, but it was now so dark we could not
see one another, and the great battle of the elements
seemed to render our puny human war
insignificant.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">195</div>
<p>I realized this would be a good time to make a
break for liberty, but our hands were tied and the
cords held by stalwart Faytans, so that we were
unable to take advantage of the opportunity.</p>
<p>Crash after crash succeeded, and the thunder
was deafening, while around us the lightning
darted like angry serpents. They have terrible
storms in these tropics, at times, and it is no
unusual thing for an island to suddenly disappear
and never be heard of again. The tempest we
now experienced was so extraordinary that I believe
it awed even the natives.</p>
<p>I could hear the sea pounding against the rocks
and wondered if the boats patrolling the reefs
could survive. An hour, perhaps, the storm lasted;
but it broke almost as suddenly as it began, and
while the trees still dripped rivulets upon us, who
were drenched to the skin already, the sun came
out brilliantly, shining for the first time that day.
The clouds tumbled away hurriedly, as if they had
business elsewhere; the wind hushed and was
still and only the fierce boom of the breakers remained
to remind us of our late fearful experience.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">196</div>
<p>The Faytans also recovered quickly. A few
moments sufficed to turn the hundreds of dusky
dripping statues into eager, alert warriors, and
again the Crooked One ordered the advance&mdash;in
the same manner previously attempted.</p>
<p>Neither Joe nor I was big enough to fully cover
the lines of gigantic warriors crowding behind us;
but the idea was that our friends would not dare
fire for fear of hitting us. If the natives could in
this manner advance close enough to stampede up
the rocks to the ship, they hoped to get enough
men aboard to conquer our small party very
quickly. For at close range the savages had no
doubt of their own superiority.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">197</div>
<p>For a time it seemed their plot would be successful.
Joe and I held back as much as we could,
with that pushing crowd behind us, but steadily
we approached the ship and no sign came from
those on board. I began to be worried. Surely
Uncle Naboth and Ned Britton were too clever to
allow a lot of half naked islanders to outwit them;
yet not a head appeared above the bulwarks, not a
puff of smoke or rifle ball proved that our tried
and trusty seamen were prepared to sell their lives
dearly and defend the women to the last.</p>
<p>We had reached the first of the rocks that clustered
above the shore and had began to stumble
over them when, with an abruptness that fairly
made me jump, a near by crack of firearms saluted
us and a straggling volley was poured upon the
devoted natives. Not from the ship, however;
the shots came from a ridge of rocks directly to
the left of us, and the Faytans began falling by
the dozens.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drop, Joe!&rdquo; I cried, and at the same time fell
flat upon my face between two protecting rocks
and lay there while the slaughter continued.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">198</div>
<p>I was exulting in the strategy that had outflanked
the Faytans and reflecting that our boys
had made a dash for those rocks during the darkness
of the storm, when their movements could not
be observed, when two stout arms seized me and
raised me bodily from the ground. I thought at
first some of our own people had rescued me, but
being turned face down over a broad shoulder I
saw the dusky skin of a savage below me and
knew that I had been taken by a Faytan.</p>
<p>Instantly I began to struggle and cry out, but
bound as I was I could offer no serious resistance
and my howls were almost drowned by the crack
of rifles, which continued unabated. I know now
that my friends saw my plight and Ned and Se&ntilde;or
de Jiminez, who were both splendid shots, made
one or two attempts to bring down my captor; but
my sprawling body so covered him that only his
head and legs were free, and to fire at him at all
was to put me in imminent danger.</p>
<p>He was a powerful fellow, and fairly ran with
me&mdash;no light burden, if I am small&mdash;back to the
forest. There were few of his band as successful
and he doubtless owed his own safety to the fact
that he bore me upon his back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
<p>The &ldquo;stinging weapons&rdquo; had played fearful
havoc with the attacking party, and even as the
few stragglers who survived&mdash;most of them
wounded&mdash;crept back to the protecting forest, our
men sallied from the rocks, hastily stripped the
pearl ornaments from the fallen, and regained the
ship without a single casualty.</p>
<p>I stood among the trees watching them, with the
king at one side of me and the Crooked One on
the other side. My joy was equaled by the chagrin
of my enemies when we saw Joe was safe with
his comrades and being complimented on all sides,
while the ladies waved their handkerchiefs to him
from the deck of the ship.</p>
<p>We were a silent party. I, because I was so
disappointed and disgusted at my hard luck that
I could almost have cried, and the others because
their prettily conceived plan of attack had been
thwarted and their warriors mowed down by
scores.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is useless, your Majesty,&rdquo; announced the
Crooked One, regretfully; &ldquo;the weapons of the
pale-skins are too bitter for us to face. The other
plan is best. It will require time and patience;
but it is best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, then,&rdquo; replied the King, briefly. &ldquo;We
will return to the city.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">200</div>
<p>&ldquo;What is the other plan?&rdquo; I inquired, as we
were conducted to our litters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall let thirst and hunger fight for us,&rdquo;
answered Attero, readily. &ldquo;Your people will soon
need fresh water; but they cannot get it without
entering the forest, where my warriors will
patiently await them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I got into my litter, where my bonds were removed
and I was borne along by my bearers
beside the king.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did the boats escape the storm?&rdquo; I asked
presently.</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. There was less danger to them on
the water than to us in the forest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the reefs&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My men are fishes first, and warriors afterward.
They are used to storms and do not dread
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did not see how any living thing could withstand
the breakers on the reefs, but said nothing
more on that subject.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">201</div>
<p>The king was unusually quiet and seemed not
to wish to converse with me. I could not well
blame him, seeing he had just witnessed the destruction
of many of his choicest fighting men.</p>
<p>Dismally enough we made our way back to the
Pearl City, where to my satisfaction I was taken
to my old room at the back of the temple. I missed
Joe, but was glad he was safe with his friends. It
was not the room that I cared especially for, but
the evidence that I still retained the young king&rsquo;s
good will. Had he ordered me to some other
place in close confinement, I might know my end
was not very far off.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">202</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XIV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">A DESPERATE ATTEMPT</span></h2>
<p>Attero sent for me the following day and asked
me to continue my descriptions of American life.
In view of the fact that he was determined upon
the destruction of our entire band I thought best
to impress upon him our national importance and
to assure him that, as our ships sailed every sea,
it was only a question of time when others would
discover Faytan and come in such numbers that
they could not be successfully opposed. Also I
explained many of the luxuries and conveniences
we enjoyed, of which the Faytans were wholly
ignorant, and informed the king that he and his
people could readily secure them all in exchange
for a portion of their pearls.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">203</div>
<p>&ldquo;At present the pearls are of no value to you,&rdquo;
said I, &ldquo;as you can use them only as ornaments.
But by disposing of even your smallest ones you
can secure practical inventions and manufactured
goods that would have the effect of civilizing your
people and render their lives far more pleasant and
useful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Attero thought deeply upon this matter, and I
could see my arguments tempted him; but neither
during this interview nor others could I overthrow
the prejudices inherited from a long line of exclusive
ancestors, who believed Faytan was the
important portion of the world and none but Faytans
must ever be permitted to live upon the island.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would like the good things the pale-skins
have,&rdquo; he admitted, &ldquo;but not at the price we would
have to pay. Our riches lie in our pearls; not because
they could be exchanged for so many other
things, but because they bring us good luck, and
the vast collection we have keeps the Pearl God
here among us, and thus insures his protection.
We are now prosperous and do not miss your great
inventions because we have never had them. But
if we allowed you to go away and return with
more of your people, think what would happen!
Our happy life would become one of turmoil and
eagerness to gain worldly goods. Some of my
people would want more than their share, and that
would lead to envy and quarrels. At present all
property belongs to the King, and each of his subjects
is given what he requires. My people are
content with this condition and it would be foolish
for me to change it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">204</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I have another proposition.
Allow us to leave this island, and do you come
with us as our guest. We will take you to America
and show you our cities and our great civilization.
You will acquire much wisdom, much learning and
experience. And afterward, if you still desire it,
we will bring you back here, land you upon your
island, and go away without telling anyone of
Faytan or its king. We will faithfully keep your
secret, your Majesty, and you will be no worse off
than before we came, but far richer in knowledge
of the world.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">205</div>
<p>I thought this would win him, for a time; but
finally he rejected the plan, as he did all others I
suggested. We talked together on several days,
but my stories of our life and the wonders of our
civilization seemed to content him. One evening
he said to me:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have given me much to think of, Steele;
and after you are dead I shall remember you as a
good teacher. I am even sorry the law compels
me to put you to death; but it does, and my chiefs
and medicine men are beginning to reproach me
for the delay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The King is supreme,&rdquo; I said rather uneasily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because he obeys the same laws his subjects
do,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;Were I to disobey the laws
of my great ancestors there would soon be rebels
and traitors in Faytan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I remembered the suggestion of the Crooked
One.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The King who makes the laws has power to
change them,&rdquo; I asserted. &ldquo;If you proclaim a new
law, saying that I, your friend, must be permitted
to live, your subjects will accept it willingly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He smiled and looked at me rather pityingly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">206</div>
<p>&ldquo;It would please me to do that,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;but
it would be wrong. I must not, for my own
pleasure, disobey my forefathers, who in their wisdom
said that all strangers must be put to death.
Is my own judgment so perfect that I dare oppose
that of twenty noble rulers of Faytan? No. I
have the power to save you in that way; but I
will not do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;we will speak of this
matter again, some other time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gave me a steady look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There will be no opportunity,&rdquo; was his reply.
&ldquo;I like you, Steele. I am glad you have been my
friend. But to-morrow you will be put to death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have waited too long already. My people
are unhappy to see a pale-skin alive when the law
condemns him to death. It will be to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait, your Majesty&mdash;hear me!&rdquo; I pleaded.</p>
<p>He waved me aside with a haughty gesture and
left the room. The Faytans are philosophers and
accept death without a murmur. The king, my
friend, could not understand my protest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">207</div>
<p>Friend? Well, it was a queer sort of friendship
that made no effort to save me; that had no sympathy
for my unhappy fate.</p>
<p>I am a good deal of a coward at times. That
night I could not sleep. Thinking over my predicament
with sober care I could see no possible
way of escape. My prison was well guarded. If
I managed to leave it there was no chance of my
being able to pass through the native city and gain
the ship unchallenged. Still, desperate conditions
require desperate remedies, and I had my two revolvers
in my pocket, both fully loaded. About
midnight it occurred to me to make a bold dash
for liberty. If I failed I could be no worse off
than now, since I was condemned to die the next
morning.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">208</div>
<p>The windows of my room were not glazed or
barred. They were big square openings placed
about five feet above the floor. By standing on
the stone bench that ran around the room I could
look out upon the square at the rear of the temple.
I had no light; neither was there any light burned
outside; but the stars were bright enough for me
to observe all surrounding objects distinctly. I
found the square deserted save by a solitary form
standing almost directly beneath my window, his
back toward me. A blanket covered his head and
shoulders, for the natives dread the chill night air
and usually wear a blanket in this manner when
abroad at night.</p>
<p>I waited for the man to move away, but when
a half hour passed and he did not stir I decided
he was a sentry placed there to prevent my escape.
It was the first time a guard of any sort had been
set to watch over me.</p>
<p>The sight of his blanket gave me an idea. I
gathered up one of the heaviest of those with
which my bench was provided and creeping into
the thick embrasure of the window I spread the
blanket, dropped it swiftly over the head of the
sentry, and then leaped down and caught him
firmly around the arms, bearing him to the
ground with my weight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">209</div>
<p>Although muffled in the blanket, which obstructed
free action, the fellow struggled desperately,
and I soon realized I could not subdue him.
I dared not fire a revolver, as the sound would
bring a horde upon me; so I managed to draw my
pocket knife and open the blade. With this I
stabbed repeatedly at the blanket, trying to reach
the man&rsquo;s heart, but the cloth was so thick and
closely woven that the rather blunt end of my knife
would not penetrate it, and all the while I was
having greater difficulty in holding him down.</p>
<p>Rendered desperate by this condition I suddenly
sprang away and made for the nearest alley that
led out of the square, leaving the sentry to fumble
with the blanket until he could free his head.</p>
<p>Before he could do this I had entered a narrow
street, up which I ran at my best speed. By good
luck it led westward, and I had visions of making
a successful run across the island when suddenly in
the darkness a pair of strong arms were flung
around me and I was pinioned in a viselike grip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; said a low, sneering voice, in the
native tongue. &ldquo;It is not wise to walk out at
night. The dews of Faytan are dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the Crooked One.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">210</div>
<p>Panting and breathless I stood an unresisting
prisoner, for I knew the game was up. But I did
not reply, understanding that any remark would
only call forth more triumphant sneers. As we
stood there footsteps hastily approached and another
joined us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you got him?&rdquo; asked the newcomer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, your Majesty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said Attero. &ldquo;He nearly smothered
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your Majesty&rsquo;s pardon,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I had
no idea it was you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And had you known&mdash;what then?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe I should have acted in the same way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Crooked One laughed, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;While I hold him, your Majesty will do well to
search him. He may carry dangerous weapons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Attero had no hesitation in obeying this request.
He took away my revolvers. My knife I
had dropped in the square. Then I was led back
to my prison.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suspected,&rdquo; said the Crooked One as he
thrust me into my old room, &ldquo;that on this night
you would attempt to escape, knowing you are to
die to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">211</div>
<p>&ldquo;It was but natural,&rdquo; added the king, calmly.
&ldquo;So we watched, my chieftain and I, that we
might prevent it. Good night, Steele. Myself, I
cannot sleep because of your impending doom. It
makes me very unhappy. But die you must.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With these words he left me, but the Crooked
One remained to say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every street is well guarded. Escape is impossible.
Be patient, therefore, for no man can
evade his fate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shuffled after the king, and left alone I
threw myself upon the bench and waited for daylight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">212</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">MY EXECUTION</span></h2>
<p>I have several times been in danger of a violent
death, and yet I still survive. &ldquo;No man can evade
his fate,&rdquo; said the Crooked One; yet it is equally
true that no man knows or can foresee his fate.
One who frequently escapes death learns to fall
back upon philosophy and ceases to worry overmuch.</p>
<p>I must have fallen asleep after a time, for when
I opened my eyes the sun was flooding the room
and my usual breakfast of milk and fruits stood
upon the bench near me. I had scarcely finished
the meal when in came a dozen Faytan warriors,
headed by the Crooked One himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you ready?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What if I am not?&rdquo; I retorted. &ldquo;You intend
I shall go with you, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">213</div>
<p>He inclined his head gravely&mdash;not mockingly.
Even he, standing in the presence of death, respected
my feelings.</p>
<p>They did not bind me, but led me out between
close files of the warriors. In the square was a
vast crowd, silent and attentive. With my guard
I passed to the east and took the broadest thoroughfare&mdash;that
leading to the bay.</p>
<p>I had never been in this direction before, but I
remembered seeing the water front from the airship
when Joe and I first entered the city. The
crowd swayed back to let us pass and then closed
up behind us, following after in a long procession.</p>
<p>It was not far to the beautiful landlocked bay
before which the Pearl City had been built, and
when it came into full view I found the water
thickly covered with boats of every description.
The entire populace seemed to have turned out to
witness my execution, and the occasion partook of
the nature of a festival, for boats, barges and
buildings were gay with the peculiar banners these
people use for decoration. They were of all colors
and shapes, and every one was bordered with
pearls.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">214</div>
<p>One of the biggest flat-bottomed barges, manned
by a score of oarsmen, lay at the foot of the street
waiting to receive us. I stepped aboard, the
guards followed and the Crooked One took a seat
beside me. Then, while the crowd scrambled for
all the empty boats remaining, our oarsmen dipped
their paddles and we moved slowly away toward
the center of the bay.</p>
<p>A clear space, several hundred feet in diameter,
had been left for my exclusive use, and I looked
at it rather disapprovingly because the clear,
smooth stretch of water was destined, seemingly,
to extinguish all my future hopes and ambitions.
Death by drowning may be a merciful mode of
execution, but I do not think any condemned person
can look with composure upon death in any
form. For my part I took a sudden aversion to
water, although I had always loved it before.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">215</div>
<p>First we drew up before the royal barge, in
which sat the young king upon a high seat.
Around this place, and indeed all around the
clear space in the bay, were clustered hundreds of
boats, so densely packed that their sides touched.
Every boat had as many passengers as it would
hold, but the natives were quiet and no shouts nor
jeering did I hear.</p>
<p>Standing up beside me the Crooked One bowed
low before the king and said in a loud voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is a stranger who has dared to land upon
the shores of Faytan. What shall be done with
him, King of Faytan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him die,&rdquo; answered the king, speaking so
that all might hear.</p>
<p>With an abruptness that startled me, all that
vast concourse repeated the sentence after him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him die!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a veritable roar of voices, expressing all
the restrained repugnance of the people for a
stranger and their demand for vengeance. It was
not so much personal hatred on their part as a
desire that I should pay the long deferred penalty
for my crime&mdash;the crime of being shipwrecked on
their coast.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">216</div>
<p>The chieftain resumed his seat and motioned to
the oarsmen. With their former deliberation they
paddled us out into the clear space, until we had
reached the very center of it. Quite naturally I
had expected to be bound and have a weight
attached to me before I was thrown overboard to
drown, but it transpired that this was not the
Faytan custom. The king had said he was merciful
and did not torture his victims, yet it was with
a thrill of horror that I realized my death was to
be made a spectacle for the delectation of the
natives, who were assembled to watch and enjoy
my struggles as I slowly drowned.</p>
<p>Two strong warriors caught me up and tossed
me into the water without any warning or preparation.
Then the barge receded to a position
beside that of the king, leaving me to my fate.</p>
<p>I am a good swimmer, having lived on the water
all my life. After the plunge I arose to the surface,
supported myself and looked about me. My
clothes were a drag upon me, so I managed to
divest myself of my coat and my shoes while I
trod water.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">217</div>
<p>Why I should make what appeared a useless
struggle for a brief period of life was not clear to
my mind just then. I was the center of a great
theater and thousands of eyes watched me with
grave interest. At the edge of the clearing a man
was stationed in the prow of every boat with an
uplifted spear to prevent my clinging to the side.
They wanted me to struggle. The longer I tried
to keep above water the longer the spectacle would
last. No matter how powerful a swimmer I might
prove I would wear out my strength in time, and
they were prepared to wait patiently to witness my
antics and my final conquest.</p>
<p>The thought came to me to disappoint them by
letting myself quietly drown at once; but so
strong is hope in the human breast that I abandoned
the idea and determined, instead, to fight
it out to the very end.</p>
<p>I rested leisurely upon my back, trying to avoid
giving way to excitement and wondering how long
I could last, when suddenly a dark object swept
across the sky, approaching me with marvelous
rapidity. In an instant I knew it was the biplane,
and the knowledge so excited me that it was almost
fatal. I rolled over and began to sink; then I
struggled to the surface to find the airship just
over me.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">218</div>
<p>&ldquo;Catch hold of the frame&mdash;here&mdash;anywhere!&rdquo;
called an eager voice&mdash;eager though it strove to
be calm.</p>
<p>I raised myself and made a frantic effort to
obey, but failed and sank again. When I came
to the surface a moment later the biplane was
circling over the bay. Again it came toward me,
and this time it dipped until it nearly touched the
water. I grabbed the frame as it passed by and
clung to it desperately, for it nearly jerked my
arms from their sockets.</p>
<p>Arrows were whizzing about me in a cloud; the
natives were shouting angrily and a thousand
boats were rushing toward us; but the next instant
I was high in the air, dangling from the frail
crossbar of the lower plane, and my safety was
only a question of whether I could hang on or not.</p>
<p>A face bent over me from the seat and stared
into mine&mdash;a girl&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lucia!&rdquo; I cried in wonder.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">219</div>
<p>&ldquo;Save your breath and hold on!&rdquo; she returned.
&ldquo;Can you manage it, Sam?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try&mdash;for awhile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Till we get to the ship?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m afraid not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indeed, this rush through the air was fast driving
the life out of me. My arms and hands were
so numb there was no feeling in them at all. Lucia
had straightened up to attend to the machine, and
the next thing I knew I bumped the earth, lost
my hold, and went rolling over and over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick!&rdquo; cried the girl. &ldquo;Let me help you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I sat up, quite dazed, and glanced about me.
We were in an open field, just now deserted by
the natives, and Alfonso&rsquo;s <i>Antoinette</i> rested upon
the ground a short distance away. I could not
have stood alone, but Lucia dragged me to my
feet and half supported me while I tottered to the
machine. It was a great effort to climb aboard,
but the girl, naturally strong and rendered doubly
so by excitement, got me into the seat and then
deftly started the motors as she sprang up beside
me.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">220</div>
<p>The machine rolled along the ground a little
way, lifted its nose and then soared into the air
like a bird. I was still marveling at the girl&rsquo;s
wonderful control of the a&euml;roplane when the ship
came in sight. We dipped downward, the motor
ceased to whir and the next moment we gracefully
alighted full upon the deck of the ship.</p>
<p>A mighty cheer rang in my ears. Then all
turned black and I lost consciousness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">221</div>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XVI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE WAY IT HAPPENED</span></h2>
<p>When I recovered I was surrounded by my
friends. Father and Uncle Naboth were administering
restoratives while Ned Britton, Alfonso and
Se&ntilde;or de Jiminez stood by in a sympathetic group
with the sailors for a background. Lucia, squatted
in a heap upon the deck, was sobbing into a wet
handkerchief. Evidently, now that the adventure
was over, the brave girl was wholly unnerved.</p>
<p>Still dazed, but trying to collect my thoughts, I
sat up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Joe?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>My father was silent and Uncle Naboth shook
his head. Lucia redoubled her sobs. This made
me anxious. I got upon my feet with an effort
and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he here?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">222</div>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Lucia, spreading out her hands with
a piteous gesture. &ldquo;He is in the Pearl City. I
left him there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, by degrees, they explained it all to me.
Joe could not rest contented while he knew I was
in danger, and from his knowledge of King Attero
he believed the savage ruler would drown me as
soon as I ceased to interest him in my tales of the
civilized world. He confided his fears to Lucia,
and suggested that as the biplane was still reposing
upon the roof of the house in the Pearl
City, he might rescue me by its aid if he could
succeed in getting there. He had already crossed
the island twice, and believed he could make the
trip in a single night. Lucia encouraged him to
make the attempt, and offered to go with him; but
he would not allow her to do that. When Joe
mentioned the matter to father and Uncle Naboth
they both disapproved the idea, considering it a
hopeless and foolhardy adventure. They did not
forbid him to go, however, but said if he undertook
the thing he must do so on his own responsibility.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">223</div>
<p>My friend would not be dissuaded, but he confided
no further in my relatives and went about
his preparations in his own way. With Lucia&rsquo;s
aid he made a stain that dyed his skin to a copper
color, and then stripped himself of all clothing except
a loin cloth such as the Faytans wore. He
took a blanket and his revolvers and then, when all
was ready and night came, Lucia let down a
knotted rope for him and he climbed down the side
unobserved and began his journey.</p>
<p>The girl, meantime, had made up her mind not
to be deprived of the glory of a share in the adventure.
With the impulsiveness of a Spaniard in
her was united the athletic training of an American
girl, and her romantic nature impelled her to
an act that was no less than folly. She silently
followed Joe and tracked him more than half way
across the island before he discovered her. Then
he was in a dilemma. She positively refused to
return to the ship, and he did not like to have her
do so unattended. On the other hand he had an
intuition that I was in immediate danger and
time pressed, so he dared not go back and postpone
the event. Therefore he unwillingly permitted
the girl to accompany him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">224</div>
<p>After they had succeeded in passing the warriors
in the forest they met no delays on their
journey and before daybreak arrived at the city.
Joe found the house where we had left the airship,
but could not get in. He secreted himself
and Lucia in a nook between two rear buildings
until morning, when the family that inhabited the
place arose. By good luck they managed to creep
in unobserved and made their way to the roof,
where they found the biplane had been left undisturbed.
The natives knew nothing of its operation
and perhaps regarded the machine with
superstitious awe.</p>
<p>In overhauling the machine Joe discovered that
Lucia understood it as well as he did. She had
watched us put it together and repair it after
Alfonso&rsquo;s accident and had listened carefully and
intelligently while we were instructed in its use.
Now she helped Joe adjust it, and they got it in
order just as I was led out for my execution.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">225</div>
<p>Peering over the edge of the roof Joe watched
me being led away and at first could not understand
what was up. But when the entire population
not already gathered at the water front
hurried after us, he gave a shrewd guess that the
hour of my execution was at hand.</p>
<p>He knew pretty well what the programme
would be. I was to be drowned in sight of the
watching Faytans. The water front was not
visible from their station on the housetop, but
Lucia proposed she should take a flight in the
airship and find out how seriously I was in danger.</p>
<p>He allowed her to go for two reasons. One
was that he believed he could start the machine
all right from the roof, which she could not do.
And then, if she found a chance to rescue me, we
could go back to the ship in the biplane and Lucia
and I would both be saved. To go himself meant
to leave her there alone upon the roof, in a strange
city and surrounded by enemies.</p>
<p>Of course her mission was a desperate one at
the best; but Joe considered it less hazardous than
for her to be left upon the roof, and the biplane
could not be trusted to carry three.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">226</div>
<p>He questioned Lucia closely, and her knowledge
of the machine was more accurate than his own.
She had never operated it, but neither had he,
for that matter, so in the end he let her go.</p>
<p>The biplane was started safely at the first attempt,
and Lucia rose well into the air and circled
around until she got her bearings and could overlook
the tragedy being enacted on the bay. Then,
seeing my danger, she headed directly for me&mdash;and
the result you know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is he now?&rdquo; I asked Lucia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still in the Pearl City,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Before
I left him he said he would hide until to-night
and then make his way back across the island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he say where he would hide?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. He was afraid some one would visit
the roof as soon as the natives found that the airship
had been taken away. So, while every one
was on the water front, he intended to steal away
and hide in the room that used to be your prison,
at the back of the temple. He said no one would
think of looking for him there, and he could get
in through the windows and get out again when
it grew dark.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">227</div>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t like that plan very well, and began to
be worried about my friend. I found my strength
returning rapidly and as soon as I could get about
I began to examine the airship, to see if it was in
proper order. Alfonso, his arm in a sling and
his head well bandaged, sauntered up to me and
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You fellows seem to have little respect for the
property of others. See what trouble you&rsquo;ve
caused by stealing my <i>Antoinette</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; I admitted. &ldquo;What will you
take for the machine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t sell it. It belongs to the revolution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the revolution can&rsquo;t use it just now,
and I can,&rdquo; I returned. &ldquo;So if you won&rsquo;t sell it
I&rsquo;ll borrow it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to look for Joe. Those Faytans
are in an ugly temper just now, and they&rsquo;ll make
a quick end of him if they find him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">228</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a fool, Sam,&rdquo; cautioned Uncle
Naboth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joe can take care of himself,&rdquo; added my
father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I could, too; but if Joe hadn&rsquo;t tried
to help me I&rsquo;d be drowned by this time. Do you
think I ought to desert a comrade, father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at me thoughtfully a moment. Then
he muttered as he turned away:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do as you like, Sam. You know best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I turned to Alfonso.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about the biplane?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;Can I
borrow it, or must I steal it again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it and welcome,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Joe&rsquo;s a
good fellow. I wish I could go after him myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alfonso wasn&rsquo;t half bad for a South American.
He had his faults, but a lot of good qualities
with them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t go just now,&rdquo; warned Lucia, who
had been listening to us with nervous attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">229</div>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; She pointed to the sky, and for the
first time I noticed that it was a leaden gray. The
sun had not wholly disappeared, but was a half
luminous ball glowing through murky clouds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another of them blamed storms is comin&rsquo;,&rdquo;
remarked Uncle Naboth; &ldquo;but we don&rsquo;t have to
shorten sail for &rsquo;em while we&rsquo;re floatin&rsquo; on dry
land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The other storm didn&rsquo;t come that way, sir,&rdquo;
observed Ned Britton, gravely.</p>
<p>We were silent now, for darkness fell upon us
suddenly. It was almost as if a light had been
extinguished at night. There wasn&rsquo;t a breath of
air stirring and the sea was like glass, but a queer
moaning sound came to our ears and we could
not discover what caused it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better get below, Lucia, and look after your
mother,&rdquo; said Alfonso.</p>
<p>I could hear her move away obediently, but
was unable to see any of the forms that stood
around me.</p>
<p>We waited for we knew not what, and the
unseen but recognized danger filled us with awe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">230</div>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XVII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE CONSEQUENCES</span></h2>
<p>Suddenly the deck slid from beneath my feet
and I fell flat upon my face. The ship heaved
and rolled as if it were tossing upon the waves of
the ocean, and her timbers creaked and groaned
mournfully. At the same time crash after crash
echoed around us, accompanied by a strange
rending sound, as if all creation was being torn
asunder.</p>
<p>Then the ship stood firm, as it had been before,
trembling slightly at times but no longer tossing
at its rock anchorage. The blackness continued,
however, and our men lighted the lanterns, disclosing
our white, pallid faces as we peered at
one another questioningly.</p>
<p>Black Nux had raised me to my feet and was
even yet partially supporting me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; I whispered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">231</div>
<p>&ldquo;Eart&rsquo;quake, Mars Sam,&rdquo; he replied in a calm
voice. &ldquo;Guess it all over now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were a few more trembles, and then
came the rain&mdash;in a deluge, as it had rained before.
We were all driven to seek shelter below,
and there we waited anxiously for the sky to
clear, that we might discover what cataclysms the
quake had wrought.</p>
<p>It rained for two solid hours. The darkness
continued for an hour or so longer. It lightened
gradually, so that the first intimation I had of it
was the clearing away of the shadows that had
lurked in the corners of the cabin, where the
lamplight did not penetrate. I went on deck,
where I found Ned, with Nux and Bryonia and
most of the crew, all peering anxiously through
the dim light in the direction of the sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Ned?&rdquo; I asked, joining them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The reefs!&rdquo; he said, pointing with a trembling
finger. &ldquo;Where are they, Sam?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">232</div>
<p>I also looked, straining my eyes to discover the
two jagged lines of rock jutting out of the sea
between us and the open water, as well as the boat
patrol that had guarded them ever since the day
of our shipwreck. But through the gray atmosphere
I could see nothing but the broad expanse
of ocean. The waves rolled in, one after another,
and broke against the very rocks that held the
<i>Seagull</i> a prisoner.</p>
<p>There was something queer about the position
of the ship, too. Heretofore we had been perched
between the two points of rock, full twenty feet
above the sea. Now the waves almost lapped our
sides, and instead of the rocky points being below
us, they reared themselves far above the deck on
either side.</p>
<p>I turned toward the island, from whence not a
sound was heard. The light had strengthened
sufficiently for me to see the forest line, and presently
I was aware that some of the trees near the
edge had tottered and fallen their length upon
the plain. Otherwise the landscape seemed unchanged,
and the open space between us and the
forest, which had been the scene of such deadly
conflict, looked just as it had before.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">233</div>
<p>Truly the earthquake had wrought wonders,
and in some ways had benefited us. The most
startling change was the destruction of the reefs,
leaving the sea free before us. The boats filled
with warriors, placed to guard us from escaping,
had been swallowed up with the reefs, and no
vestige of that formidable array remained except
a few fragments of the canoes which washed
ashore.</p>
<p>Perhaps inspired by a common hope we all
descended the ladders to the ground. There we
were better able to appreciate all that had happened.
Except that the sky was still gray and
forbidding, we now had plenty of light to examine
our surroundings clearly.</p>
<p>One glance at the <i>Seagull</i> dispelled our half
formed hopes. Although her keel was now on a
level with the ocean, which even lapped her bow,
the ship was wedged fast between the two huge
rocks. These must have separated during the
earthquake and allowed her to settle down into
her present position; but they still held her as in
a vise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">234</div>
<p>&ldquo;If another quake comes, which ain&rsquo;t unlikely,&rdquo;
observed Uncle Naboth, &ldquo;them rocks is liable to
come together again, in which case they&rsquo;d crack
the <i>Seagull&rsquo;s</i> sides like a nut in the jaws of a
nutcracker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was quite possible, and the statement did not
reassure us in the least.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we could but manage to launch her,&rdquo; said
Alfonso, &ldquo;we have now plenty of deep water for
her to slide into.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My uncle looked at the young Colombian reproachfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Them &lsquo;ifs&rsquo; seem to excuse a lot of fool remarks,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;The only way to launch the
<i>Seagull</i> would be with dynamite, and after that
she wouldn&rsquo;t be likely to float.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was now the middle of the afternoon, and
although the sky continued gloomy there was no
air stirring and I dared not wait longer if I
meant to rescue Joe. I was very uneasy about
my old chum, for the earthquake was likely to
have created as much havoc at the Pearl City as
it had at this end of the island.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">235</div>
<p>My father had gone into the hold with the carpenter
and Ned to examine the condition of the
ship. The little damage we had sustained from
the typhoon which had tossed the ship to her elevated
perch had already been repaired&mdash;quite
foolishly we thought. But the <i>Seagull</i> was still
dear to the heart of Captain Steele, and he took
as much care of her now that she was useless as
when she was proudly riding the waves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the programme?&rdquo; asked Uncle Naboth,
as I prepared to start.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to try to get to the city and find
Joe. If possible I&rsquo;ll get him aboard and fetch
him back with me. That&rsquo;s as far as I can plan
now, Uncle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t be foolhardy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try not to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then I took my seat, Lucia started the motors,
and a moment later I was flying over the forest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">236</div>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XVIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">A RUN FOR LIFE</span></h2>
<p>Ascending to an altitude of several hundred
feet I attempted what is called the &ldquo;spiral dip,&rdquo;
circling, in the air while gradually descending.
But the shadows lay so thick in the forest that I
could not tell whether any Faytans remained
there or not. So I rose again and headed east
across the island in the direction of the Pearl City.</p>
<p>I must have covered five of the ten miles in the
next five minutes, and the machine was working
perfectly, when on glancing down I discovered
a native sprinting across the fields at a rapid pace.
After him, but nearly a quarter of a mile away,
rushed a horde of savages. There must have
been at least two thousand of them, all intent
upon the chase.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">237</div>
<p>This was so peculiar that I did another spiral
dip to get a little closer to the scene of action,
and as I neared the ground and could see more
plainly it suddenly flashed upon me that the flying
native was Joe. Lucia had said that he had
stained his skin and dressed himself in the native
loin cloth, but I had forgotten that until now. It
explained the scene perfectly. Joe had been discovered
in the Pearl City, but had managed to
escape and was now heading for the ship, followed
by a host of pursuers.</p>
<p>My friend was a mighty runner; I knew that.
It was Joe&rsquo;s especial athletic accomplishment,
and with such a lead I believed he could keep the
Faytans behind him until he reached the ship,
unless&mdash;unless the forest still harbored an army
of warriors, in which case they could easily head
him off.</p>
<p>With this contingency in mind I resolved to
pick him up and take him with me; so, judging
the distance as accurately as I could, I swooped
downward and landed about a hundred yards
ahead of the fugitive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Climb aboard, Joe!&rdquo; I called. &ldquo;Take it easy,
old man. We&rsquo;re safe enough now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">238</div>
<p>He dashed up, panting but still full of energy,
and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can we start her, Sam?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take your seat, and I&rsquo;ll show you,&rdquo; I replied.
I had seen Lucia do the trick and thought
I could repeat it. The motor started, but the
machine would not rise. It bumped along the
rough ground a way until I became alarmed and
stopped it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try again,&rdquo; said Joe, coolly.</p>
<p>I glanced over my shoulder and found the Faytans
were getting uncomfortably near. But I
kept my wits and took time to readjust the machine
a little, so it would rise more quickly. A
half dozen or so of the pursuers were well in
advance of the others, and I suspected they might
interfere with our start. So I faced about and
carefully emptied my revolvers at them, halting
all but one. Then I turned back to the machine,
started the motor and ran beside it a few paces
before I sprang into the seat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">239</div>
<p>Just then I heard a revolver crack beside me,
but could pay no attention to it because the biplane
was speeding into the air at a tremendous
clip. It persisted in mounting upward, because
I had adjusted it that way, and in working the
steering gear to obviate this the machine got a
side motion that was both unpleasant and dangerous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steady her, Sam!&rdquo; called Joe; but I couldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>To add to my perplexity it grew dark again;
the moaning sound was repeated, and looking
down I saw the earth shaking under me like a
bowl full of jelly. It was a horrible sight, and in
my agitation I must have bungled in some way,
for the fearful side motion increased, and both of
us had to hold fast to keep from being hurled
from our seats.</p>
<p>Suddenly the biplane took a dive&mdash;swift as a
bullet, but was supported from falling by the outstretched
planes. I lost all control, but managed
to shut off the motor and then cling to the frame
with all my might.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">240</div>
<p>Down, down we went, but fortunately still
gliding diagonally in the direction of the ship. It
was a regular tumble by this time, and I am
positive the biplane turned over and over several
times. We just skipped the further edge of the
forest and crashed into the branches of a fallen
tree&mdash;one of those felled by the earthquake.
With a jar that drove the breath out of me I
bounded from the branches and fell prone upon
the ground. Joe landed near me, and aside from
the severe shock we both escaped serious injury
or the breaking of bones and soon scrambled to
our feet.</p>
<p>I had turned to glance at the biplane, now a
hopeless mass of junk, when Joe suddenly
caught my hand and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must run for it, Sam!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bursting in a stream from the forest came
hundreds of Faytan warriors, brandishing their
weapons as they ran. They were so near that an
arrow or a well thrown spear might have caught
us easily, but the savages seemed intent on capturing
us.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">241</div>
<p>I am not a great runner, but on this occasion,
at least, I did myself credit as a sprinter. Joe&rsquo;s
hand in mine and his superior swiftness helped,
of course, and we managed to keep a lead till we
were near the ship, when a volley from the deck
effectually halted our pursuers.</p>
<p>Even as we clambered up the side by means of
the ladders they let down, the sky darkened
again and another tremble shook the earth. It
made us totter, but was not severe enough to
cause any especial damage, and we were all getting
used to the quakes by this time, so were not
much frightened. Scientists have told me they
are puzzled to explain this apparent connection
between the sky and the earthquakes. Atmospheric
conditions have nothing to do with earth
convulsions, and vice versa, they say. Yet it is
a fact that in Faytan we could tell when a &ldquo;tremble&rdquo;
was coming by the sudden darkening of the
sky.</p>
<p>The Faytans were learning a few lessons by
experience. When the light became strong
enough for us to see again we found the plain
fairly alive with natives, and more were constantly
pouring in from the forest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">242</div>
<p>At once all hands were assembled at the rail
and our men lost no time in opening fire, for we
did not dare give our enemies time to attempt to
board us in such numbers, and it was now much
easier to scale our sides since the ship had settled
down to the sea level.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Train the howitzers!&rdquo; called my father, and
the gunners leaped to their posts. We had not
used the cannon before, as they had not been
required, but now the savages were massed before
us on the plain and a charge of grape and
canister was more effective than many rifle balls.</p>
<p>We took the aggressive and without waiting
to be attacked fired the two cannon, one after another,
point blank into the mass of Faytans.</p>
<p>It was still too dark for us to see just what had
been accomplished, but I shudder to think of the
wholesale destruction we must have caused.
They were doggedly determined, however, to get
the &ldquo;pale-skins&rdquo; at any cost, and if we destroyed
hundreds there were hundreds more to take their
places.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">243</div>
<p>Presently they were swarming below us so
close that the cannon were only effective in
slaughtering those crowding the plain behind
them, and every one of us able to hold a rifle
stood at the rail and picked off the nearest of our
enemies. Their method of getting aboard was
curiously primitive. One man clung to the end
of a long pole, which others raised in the air and
lifted so he could catch our rail. We had little
difficulty at first in shooting these down as fast
as they were raised to our level; but the attack
was concerted with some skill, and every inch
of the rail needed to be guarded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be the young king who is directing
this battle,&rdquo; I said to Joe as we stood side by side,
firing whenever we saw a head appear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be the king,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I shot him
just as you carried me off in the biplane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shot the king!&rdquo; I exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. He was right upon us and about to grab
the frame when I let go at him. Didn&rsquo;t you hear
me shoot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I was busy with the machine. I&rsquo;m
rather sorry for Attero,&rdquo; I answered, regretfully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">244</div>
<p>&ldquo;My opinion is that the Crooked One has
planned this onslaught,&rdquo; continued Joe, &ldquo;and that
he is bound to get us this time at any sacrifice.
He&rsquo;s a wily old fox.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We were too busy after that for further conversation.
The smoke and din of battle was
something terrifying, and even now I wonder that
the savages were not disheartened by the noise
and the sight of their comrades falling on all
sides of them. When we consider how unused
they were to firearms we must admit their courage
was wonderful.</p>
<p>I think we all began to realize that the situation
was serious. On deck Alfonso was fighting as
well as he could with his broken arm, while his
father stood at his side and rendered an excellent
account of himself. Below in the cabin Madam
de Alcantara had first fainted and then gone into
convulsions. Her shrill screams were not the
least disheartening sounds that reached our ears,
yet I knew Lucia and Madam de Jiminez were
with her and that the poor lady was only frightened
and not in a dying condition.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">245</div>
<p>The constant tax on our nerves and the need
to be constantly alert was fast wearing out the
strongest of us. Bryonia, who had fought nobly,
came over to me presently and suggested that we
get the women into one of the small boats and
launch it while all of us covered the retreat with
our guns. He thought they might escape in that
way, whereas we were almost certain to be overcome
at length by sheer force of numbers, and
then all would be doomed.</p>
<p>I did not approve of the attempt myself, but
counseled with my father and Uncle Naboth,
who promptly turned down the proposition.
Just then four Faytans succeeded in leaping
aboard, and were engaged in a hand to hand
fight with Nux and Bry, who met them, when
Ned got a sword through one and Joe disposed
of another with a pistol shot. That evened the
numbers and our blades were not long in ridding
themselves of their opponents.</p>
<p>But this temporary invasion was a warning
that we were losing ground and our enemies gaining
confidence, so we redoubled our activity and
found plenty to do in protecting ourselves from
the boarders.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">246</div>
<h2 id="c19"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XIX</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">A CAPRICIOUS EARTHQUAKE</span></h2>
<p>The fight was still raging fiercely when blackness
fell upon us once more, and for the first time
I became panic-stricken. The sky had not been
clear all day, but we had managed to see until
now, ever since the fight began, but with a black
pall hanging all around us and thousands of enemies
marking us for death the outlook was absolutely
terrifying. The Faytans had not been
afraid of the dark before, and if now they had
the temerity to continue the attack we could not
hope to resist them long.</p>
<p>My fears were soon justified. I heard Joe
cry: &ldquo;Look out, Sam!&rdquo; and felt rather than saw
a big warrior standing before me. The moaning
sound that preceded a quake sang in my ears as
I struck out furiously with my cutlass, and then
the ship reared her stem and pitched us all in a
struggling mass down the incline of the deck to
the bow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">247</div>
<p>I struck against a naked body and two hands
grasped my throat and effectually stopped my
breath until I got a pistol out and shot my assailant
dead. At least he relaxed his hold and slid
away from me&mdash;and I slid too, rolling and bumping
against obstacles of every sort till my bones
cracked. And now through the pitch darkness
everything seemed to go&mdash;ship and all&mdash;and a
sheet of water struck me and made me gasp.</p>
<p>The <i>Seagull</i> was level now, but rolled from
side to side while big waves dashed over her and
rushed out of the scuppers in a perpetual stream.
I heard a faint cheer from the forecastle; but
now the elements were in a wild turmoil and I
was too utterly bewildered to think.</p>
<p>The wind had instantly risen to a gale; the
waves beat upon us in fury, and through the darkness
the <i>Seagull</i> floundered here and there in an
aimless way that was puzzling and perilous.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">248</div>
<p>While I clung to a bit of rigging and tried to
get my breath I realized but one thing clearly&mdash;that
the ship was afloat again. An earthquake
more severe than any that had previously occurred
had split the two rocks asunder and allowed
her to slide into the sea. But where were
we now? And where were the Faytans?</p>
<p>It takes a good deal to phase Captain Steele.
Even while I stood marveling my father had
grasped the wheel, and, as our rudder and screw
had been fully repaired the aimless pitching of
the ship was rectified as soon as her head was
brought to the wind and she faced the waves.
Then suddenly the sky brightened sufficiently for
us to see one another again.</p>
<p>In the bow stood huddled a group of nearly a
dozen Faytan warriors, while our men were scattered
here and there clinging to whatever support
they could find. I found that Joe wasn&rsquo;t a
dozen yards away from me. The <i>Seagull</i> was
floating serenely on a rather turbulent sea and
the coast of Faytan was a quarter of a mile on
our lee.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">249</div>
<p>We stared at the warriors a moment, and they
stared at us. Then with one accord we all made
an advance toward the savages, determined to
settle the fight the first thing we did. They did
not wait for us, but leaped the rail into the sea
and began swimming toward their island.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let &rsquo;em go!&rdquo; shouted my father. &ldquo;And some
of you get busy and toss those bodies overboard.
Where&rsquo;s the firemen? Step lively, lads, and get
up steam as soon as the Lord&rsquo;ll let you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men gave a cheer and responded with
alacrity. We stripped all the pearl ornaments
from the dead natives that cluttered the deck, and
afterward threw the bodies overboard. During
this operation I came upon Se&ntilde;or de Jiminez
seated in the scupper with his back to the bulwark
and sobbing like a baby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is anything wrong, sir?&rdquo; I asked anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no! Everything is right,&rdquo; he answered.
&ldquo;We are saved&mdash;the revolution is saved! Hurrah
for the revolution!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joy affects some people that way, but I have
no patience with men who cry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">250</div>
<p>We got up steam presently, but found the <i>Seagull</i>
was leaking like a sieve. It took all the
power of our engines to keep the pumps going;
so my father ordered sail hoisted, and as the wind
had moderated to a stiff breeze we were soon
bowling along with the mainsail and jib set. The
mizzenmast had gone by the board at the time of
the wreck.</p>
<p>My father&rsquo;s face wore an anxious expression
and he called Uncle Naboth and me into the cabin
for a consultation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can keep afloat this way for a time&mdash;perhaps
for days, if the leaks don&rsquo;t get worse,&rdquo; he
said; &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s foolish to take such chances.
There are islands near by, I&rsquo;m sure. Shall we
stop at the first one we sight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H-m. It might prove to be another Faytan,&rdquo;
said my uncle, doubtfully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had enough
fighting to last me for a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a moment,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I want to get
Bry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo; demanded my father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the only one aboard who knows these
seas,&rdquo; I replied.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">251</div>
<p>Bryonia came to the cabin and being questioned
declared that he knew the way to his own
island of Tuamotu from here, but could not tell
how to get from there back to our regular course.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, though,&rdquo; said Captain Steele, &ldquo;for
Tuamotu is marked on my chart. It seems a
French ship stopped there once, and did some
trading with the natives, so I&rsquo;ve got it pretty
fairly located.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what sort of a reception will your people
give us, Bry?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>He smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Chief of Tuamotu,&rdquo; he answered
proudly. &ldquo;I am equal to a king. My friends will
be welcome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said my father. &ldquo;Take the wheel,
Bry, and steer us towards Tuamotu.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bry became navigator then, and although he
knew nothing of the science he possessed an instinct
that guided him correctly. Having once
been over the course from Tuamotu to Faytan he
had the points firmly fixed in his mind, and as the
distance was only about a hundred miles and the
breeze held finely, on the second day we sighted
a big island which both Bry and Nux declared to
be Tuamotu.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_252">252</div>
<p>Meantime a semblance of order had been restored
to the ship. From being in the depths of
despair our passengers were now elated with
hope. They paid little heed to the fact that water
was pouring into our hold as fast as the engines
could pump it out, for having escaped the more
tangible dangers of Faytan they believed our
luck had changed and all would now be well
with us.</p>
<p>Our men realized the situation and wore grave
looks. But Lucia pounded the piano and sang
her Spanish songs; Se&ntilde;or de Jiminez resumed
his writing of the speech to be delivered before
the Colombian Congress, and Madam de Alcantara
dressed herself in her most gorgeous robes
and declared she had enjoyed her recent adventure
except for a sad attack of &ldquo;nerves.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_253">253</div>
<p>Joe and I made a list of the pearls we had secured
at Faytan, including those rifled from the
dead bodies of our enemies. They made so large
a collection and were of such extraordinary size
and color that we knew they would sell for an
immense sum in America. All of our men were
to participate in the &ldquo;prize money,&rdquo; for all had
helped to earn it.</p>
<p>Joe, however, was richer in pearls than all
the rest of us. When left by Lucia at the Pearl
City he had easily made his way unobserved to
the temple and crept through the window into
our old room. Here he remained quietly secreted
for a time, but the silence throughout the great
building was so profound that he ventured to
explore some of the passages that were unknown
to him. One of them led him to the inner shrine
of the temple, where an ugly image of the Pearl
God was installed. At the feet of this deity had
been placed the most splendid pearls found by
the Faytans for many generations past, and Joe
calmly filled the folds of his loin cloth as full as
they would hold of the choicest gems.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_254">254</div>
<p>At that moment he was discovered by an attendant,
who raised a hue and cry just as the
king was returning from the bay at the head of
his people, all heartily disgusted by my escape.
Joe managed to leap from the window and speed
away before the Faytans fully recovered from
their astonishment, and then began the race which
I had ended by taking Joe aboard the airship.</p>
<p>Next to Joe&rsquo;s splendid pearls, the value of
which would make any man rich, however
greedy he might be, my own string of gems, presented
me by Attero, was of prime importance.
Tiffany has since valued them at forty thousand
dollars, but I will not part with them. I liked
Attero and have always regretted that Joe had to
kill him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_255">255</div>
<h2 id="c20"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XX</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">KING BRYONIA</span></h2>
<p>When we sighted Tuamotu it occurred to us
that the most important person in our company
was now our cook Bryonia&mdash;or rather Louiki, as
he was called by his people. We had to depend
upon the hospitality of these natives for some
time to come; or until we had fully repaired the
leaks in the <i>Seagull</i> for the long voyage still before
us. Therefore we held a consultation and
decided to appoint Bry to the temporary office of
High Admiral, and to defer to him most respectfully
while we lay at the island. For if his people
found their chief occupying a menial position
they might lose respect for him, and cause us a
lot of trouble, whereas if he arrived clothed with
grandeur and power his prestige would be increased.
Nux also must be an important personage,
for he was the chief&rsquo;s cousin and close comrade.
It was all explained to our passengers and
crew, and so popular were the two faithful blacks
that every one entered into the spirit of the deception
with glee, expecting much amusement as
the result.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_256">256</div>
<p>Tuamotu we found a beautiful island, finely
wooded, with a range of mountains in the center,
and altogether somewhat larger than was Faytan.
As Bry had declared, there was a fine harbor,
with a shelving beach upon which we proposed to
run the <i>Seagull</i> at high tide, so as to get at her
leaks most conveniently.</p>
<p>As we entered this harbor on a bright, sunny
morning we found the shore thickly clustered
with natives, all as black as the ace of spades.
They were not, as a class, so intelligent looking
as the Faytans; neither were they so big and
powerful of frame; but comparing them with
other South Sea Islanders I must admit they
were vastly superior to the general run. There
was little ferocity about them, although I know
they can fight and are brave and sturdy warriors.
Just now they were merely curious and excited,
for ours was the first ship but one to anchor in
their bay. We had made a brave display of bunting
and flags, and when we dropped anchor and
furled our sails we fired a single shot from the
bow by way of salute.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_257">257</div>
<p>After many conferences with Bry we had decided
upon our course of action, so at once the
gig was lowered and manned by a chosen crew,
while Bry and Nux, arrayed in their best gray
and gold uniforms, gravely descended the ladder
and took their seats in the stern. I most admit
they moved with admirable dignity, and their
great size lent them an impressive appearance.
No one but us could know that the uniforms were
those of servants.</p>
<p>They were received in silence when first they
landed, but then we saw Bry stand before his
people and begin a speech, and presently a shout
arose so prolonged and loud that it was fairly
deafening. Those nearest Bry fell on their knees
and tried to kiss his feet, while those on the outskirts
leaped about, performing antics of joy.
Then a tall native advanced and folded Bry in a
cordial embrace, afterward embracing Nux in
like manner.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_258">258</div>
<p>We knew then that our men had been recognized
and loyally welcomed home. A procession
was formed to the village on the hill, and Bry and
Nux marched ahead of it while the shouts and
gambols continued unabated. The ship seemed
no longer the center of interest to the natives,
although scattered bands of them soon began to
saunter back to the shore to gaze upon the unusual
spectacle.</p>
<p>Much entertained by the reception and satisfied
that our black friends were having a good time,
we patiently awaited their return, listening the
while to the monotonous &ldquo;chug-chug&rdquo; of the
pumps as they drove out the water that persistently
rushed into the hold.</p>

<p>After a couple of hours the procession reappeared,
Bry and Nux again at the head. They
marched down to the shore and while the chief
and his cousin re&euml;ntered the gig, accompanied by
two other blacks, three canoe loads of favored
individuals clung to their wake and followed
them to the ship as invited guests. At a respectful
distance a swarm of other canoes came toward
us, but they kept their distance from the
ship and had no disposition to intrude.</p>
<p>We received the visitors with great ceremony.
Nux told us that the tall black&mdash;he who had first
embraced them&mdash;was his own brother. When
the old chief, Bry&rsquo;s father, had passed away, this
man became the successor to the rule of the island,
as all thought that the legitimate heir, Louiki,
had perished in the battle with the Faytans. So
Nux&rsquo;s brother had been chief until Bry&rsquo;s return
when, being a good fellow at heart, he welcomed
the long lost one and gladly resigned the royal
office in his favor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_260">260</div>
<p>In this party were the principal men and officials
of the island, and Bry showed them all over
&ldquo;his&rdquo; ship, afterward giving them a plentiful
feast in the main cabin. Joe and I waited upon
them, and it was fun to see Bry at one end of
the table and Nux at the other, posing as the
ruling spirits of the <i>Seagull</i>. My father and Uncle
Naboth kept out of sight, as did all our passengers,
although Alfonso and Lucia hid on deck
and looked through the cabin windows at the
savage feasters. The natives of Tuamotu were
duly impressed by the magnificent surroundings
of their chief, and when, he told them his ship
needed repairs and tinkering they gladly volunteered
to render him every assistance in their
power.</p>
<p>So his Majesty dismissed them and sent them
back to land, and when they were gone he put on
his apron and cooked our dinner.</p>
<p>At five o&rsquo;clock it was high tide, so we ran the
<i>Seagull</i> as far upon the sandy beach as she would
go, using the engines to propel her, and then the
natives swarmed into the water and braced her
sides securely with long poles. As the tide receded
it left us high and dry, and by daybreak
our men were able to begin work. They found
several planks badly sprung and one gaping hole
torn in the bottom by the sharp rocks as we slid
into the sea during the earthquake at Faytan.
It would take several days to repair the damage,
because we could only work part of the time,
while the tide was out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_261">261</div>
<p>Meantime, we were entertained by Bry in the
chief&rsquo;s house. It was the best in the village, or
on the island, but made of logs with a palm
thatched roof and far inferior in all ways to the
houses of Faytan. Bry gave us a native repast,
consisting mainly of roast goat and cheese, with
a variety of delicious fruits. There was constant
feasting and a succession of dances and ceremonies
in honor of the chief&rsquo;s return, and I was
curious to know how all this would affect Bry,
and whether he would leave us to rule over his
native island, or not.</p>
<p>But when the repairs were completed Bry announced
his intention of sailing with us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Allola, who is the brother of Nux, will make
my people a good chief,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and my life
with you has spoiled me to be now an ignorant
islander. I could not be contented here any
more; so I will go with you, and stay with you
always.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_262">262</div>
<p>There had never been any question about Nux.
He had always said he preferred the life on our
ship to being a big man in Tuamotu.</p>
<p>All being ready, hundreds of natives waded
into the water at high tide and by sheer force of
numbers pushed the <i>Seagull</i> off the sands till she
floated. This operation was assisted by our propeller,
but we could not have moved the heavy
ship without the aid of Bry&rsquo;s subjects.</p>
<p>The chief held a final farewell celebration, and
distributed among his people many beads and
trinkets, a stock of which we always carried with
us. Then, amid the shouts of the multitude, who
were all really sorry to see us go, we started our
engines, whistled three times and fired a gun,
and steamed out of the hospitable harbor.</p>
<p>The voyage to Colombia was without important
event. We soon got upon our course again
and encountered no more bad weather.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_263">263</div>
<p>But at our destination Se&ntilde;or de Jiminez received
some startling news. The revolution had,
by a clever coup, overthrown the unpopular government
and won without bloodshed. As De
Jiminez did not happen to be present, another
patriot was elected to the presidency, and was
doing his duty ably when we arrived.</p>
<p>So the feelings of young Alfonso and his
father were a combination of both joy and sadness;
but the joy predominated when they were
greeted enthusiastically by their political friends
and De Jiminez was publicly thanked for his
services to his party.</p>
<p>We were able to unload the guns and ammunition
without danger, after which we settled our
accounts in a satisfactory manner with the revolutionists,
who recognized all of De Jiminez&rsquo;
obligations. Then, being once more the legal
owners of the <i>Seagull</i>, we bade good-bye to our
passengers, who had shared with us the dangerous
adventure at Faytan, and steamed northward
toward San Francisco.</p>
<p>I noticed that Joe and Lucia exchanged rings,
and overheard him promise to see her again. I
wonder if he ever will?</p>

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the

claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
